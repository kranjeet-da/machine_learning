The current amount </br></br>in dispute is approximately $2 million. The capacity fees and revenues from the sale of the </br></br>reclaimed water are being held by the City pending resolution of this matter. See “—</br></br>Participating Agencies; Regional Wastewater Disposal Agreement; Transportation </br></br>Agreements.” </br> </br>The City has the right to make all decisions with respect to the planning  design  </br>construction  operation and maintenance of the Metropolitan Sub System. Decisions on issues </br></br>that impact the Participating Agencies are made with the advice of the Metropolitan </br></br>Commission. The Metropolitan Commission consists of one representative from each </br></br>Participating Agency and advocates for fair rates and other issues of importance to the </br></br>Participating Agencies. Although the Metropolitan Commission may make recommendations </br></br>to the City  the City retains ownership and decision making authority over all elements of the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System  including the capital improvements for the Metropolitan Sub </br></br>System.  </br>  26  </br>Metropolitan Sub System Facilities </br> General</br>. The current Metropolitan Sub System infrastructure  with the exception of the </br>South Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline  is located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the </br></br>City and is concentrated along a kidney shaped corridor running from Mission Bay to the </br></br>north  and along the perimeter of the San Diego Bay to the south. The map that follows the </br></br>Table of Contents of this Official Statement shows the geographic concentration of the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System’s infrastructure and identifies the major trunk lines that service the </br></br>Participating Agencies. The Metropolitan Sub System’s infrastructure currently consists of </br></br>three wastewater treatment plants  two ocean outfalls  a biosolids center  four pump stations </br></br>and force mains and gravity flow interceptors. The Metropolitan Sub System infrastructure </br></br>also includes two interceptors  which collect and route wastewater to the Point Loma Plant </br></br>from the Municipal Sub System and the Participating Agencies. The Wastewater System CIP </br></br>is dependent upon maintaining certain permits and waivers with respect to the Wastewater </br></br>System under Federal and State law. If existing permits and waivers are not maintained  the </br></br>City could incur costs in addition to those currently included in the City’s budgets and </br></br>projections. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Treatment of </br></br>Sewage.” The following is a summary description of the Metropolitan Sub System’s current </br></br>facilities and their respective primary functions. </br> </br>Point Loma Plant</br>. The Point Loma Plant began operation in 1963. The site is part of </br>the Fort Rosecrans military reservation and was acquired by the City from the U.S. </br></br>Department of the Interior  Bureau of Land Management. The Point Loma Plant is the </br></br>principal treatment facility in the Metropolitan Sub System  with a permitted treatment </br></br>capacity of 240 mgd flow with 432 mgd peak wet weather flow. During Fiscal Year 2009  the </br></br>Point Loma Plant had an average daily flow rate of 157.5 mgd  including return flows from </br></br>the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  North City Plant and South Bay Plant. The average daily </br></br>flow rate at the Point Loma Plant accounted for approximately 91.8% of the wastewater flow </br></br>generated within the Metropolitan Sub System. Almost all the inflow to the Point Loma Plant </br></br>is conveyed through the Metropolitan Sub System’s Pump Station No. 2  which is the terminus </br></br>for the North Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline and South Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline. </br></br>Flow from the North City Plant which is not distributed to reclaimed water users is returned to </br></br>the sewage conveyance system and is treated at the Point Loma Plant. In addition  the Point </br></br>Loma Plant serves as a standby facility for the North City Plant and the South Bay Plant in the </br></br>event one or both of these facilities is taken off line for maintenance purposes. </br> </br>The Point Loma Plant currently provides advanced primary treatment of sewage in </br>accordance with a waiver from the secondary treatment standards of the Clean Water Act  </br></br>which was originally received by the City in 1995  and renewed on September 13  2002 for the </br></br>period through June 2008. The City applied for an extension of the waiver and  in December </br></br>2008  the City received a tentative decision from the United States Environmental Protection </br></br>Agency  the “U.S. EPA”  that the Point Loma Plant and Point Loma Ocean Outfall  defined </br></br>herein  be granted a renewed waiver. This request is the City’s second renewal. During this </br></br>time  the present modified permit will be administratively continued. Pt Loma will continue to </br></br>operate under the provisions of the modified permit that was adopted in 2002  in full </br></br>compliance with the Clean Water Act section 301 h   as modified by the Ocean Pollution </br></br>Reduction Act.  </br> </br>The Point Loma Plant continues to operate under the current waiver through the </br>consideration and public comment process. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—Treatment of Sewage.” Treated wastewater from the Point Loma Plant is </br></br>discharged through the Point Loma Ocean Outfall  “Point Loma Outfall”   which was built in </br></br>1963. In 1993  the Point Loma Outfall was extended 2.0 miles from its original length  which </br></br>resulted in the present length of 4.5 miles. See “—Point Loma Ocean Outfall.” Ongoing capital </br> 27  </br>improvements to the Point Loma Plant are included in the Wastewater System CIP. See </br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.” </br> </br>Operations at the Point Loma Plant are monitored and controlled from a distributed  </br>computer based control system located in the Point Loma Plant’s control center. Local control </br></br>stations are also strategically located around the Point Loma Plant and can be used to access </br></br>the entire plant control system.  </br> </br>Presently  the Point Loma Plant is capable of removing 85% to 90% of total suspended </br>solids  “TSS” . The Point Loma Plant has increased its TSS removal rates through operational </br></br>improvements of its chemical treatment processes. The wastewater treatment process currently </br></br>employed at the Point Loma Plant consists of advanced primary treatment and a digester gas </br></br>utilization facility. Dewatering of sludge is provided at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center </br></br> described below . Methane gas produced during the digestion is fed to a City owned </br></br>cogeneration plant where it is converted to electricity and used to provide power to operate the </br></br>plant. Excess energy is sold back to the local electrical power grid. See “—Metropolitan </br></br>Biosolids Center.” </br> </br>North City Water Reclamation Plant</br>. The North City Water Reclamation Plant  the </br>“North City Plant”  is a sewage treatment facility that is capable of processing sewage to both </br></br>secondary and tertiary treatment levels. The North City Plant commenced operations in 1997 </br></br>and is located adjacent to Interstate 805 and Miramar Road in the northwestern quadrant of </br></br>the City. The North City Plant operates pursuant to a “Waste Discharge and Water Recycling </br></br>Requirements for the Production and Purveyance of Recycled Water ” Order No. 97 03  </br></br>Addendum No. 1  which was adopted by the California Regional Water Quality Board  the </br></br>“Regional Water Board”  on June 11  2003  the “North City Plant Permit” . The North City </br></br>Plant Permit  as amended  is effective until it is revoked or further modified. </br> </br>The North City Plant receives influent through the North City Tunnel Connector and </br>from the Penasquitos Pump Station. The North City Plant process includes screening  grit </br></br>removal  settling  flow equalization  activated sludge processing  tertiary filtration and effluent </br></br>disinfection. The Metropolitan Biosolids Center  described below  digests and dewaters the </br></br>sludge that is produced at the North City Plant. Support facilities of the North City Plant </br></br>include an administration building  operation and maintenance building and chemical </br></br>building. The North City Plant has a permitted capacity of 30 mgd average daily flow. Per the </br></br>requirements of a grant the City received from the EPA for construction of the North City </br></br>Plant  the City must treat flows equal to a minimum of 75% of the plant’s design capacity </br></br> i.e.  at least 22.5 mgd . For Fiscal Year 2009  the plant operated at an average flowrate of </br></br>approximately 22.7 mgd. The North City Plant is producing an average of 6.6 mgd of </br></br>reclaimed water that is distributed to users through the Northern Water Distribution System. </br></br>The North City Plant limits its production of reclaimed water to meet demand. Excess treated </br></br>effluent is returned to the sewer system for conveyance to the Point Loma Treatment Plant and </br></br>ocean outfall. Approximately 16.4 mgd is returned to the sewer system. See “—Point Loma </br></br>Plant.” The solids that are removed during the sewage treatment process  either by </br></br>sedimentation or biological oxidization  are pumped to the Metropolitan Biosolids Center for </br></br>further treatment. See “—Metropolitan Biosolids Center.”  </br> </br>The North City Plant currently produces reclaimed water that serves approximately </br>465 meters and two wholesale users that resell the reclaimed water for landscape irrigation. </br></br>Reclaimed water is also used for industrial processing  cooling towers  construction site dust </br></br>suppression and soil compaction  decorative fountains and toilet and urinal flushing. </br></br>Revenues from the sale of reclaimed water are collected by the Department for deposit in the </br></br>Water Utility Fund and used to pay for the cost of the reclaimed water distribution system </br></br>and then operations and maintenance costs for the distribution system. </br> 28  </br> In January 2004  the San Diego City Council authorized a comprehensive evaluation of </br>all viable options to maximize the usage of recycled water. In March 2006  the City of San </br></br>Diego  working in partnership with an Independent Advisory Panel and a City Assembly on </br></br>Water Reuse  published the “City of San Diego Water Reuse Study”  the “Water Reuse </br></br>Study” . The City’s Water Reuse Study included analysis and research on the health effects of </br></br>reuse options and a public participation process. The Reuse Study s stakeholders identified </br></br>Reservoir Augmentation at the City s San Vicente Reservoir as their preferred strategy. In </br></br>October 2007  the San Diego City Council also recognized the strategy as their preferred </br></br>alternative. </br> </br>Conducting a Water Reuse Study was the first phase of a three phased water reuse </br>program that includes the development of a Demonstration Project  phase two  that could </br></br>lead to implementation of a full scale Indirect Potable Reuse Reservoir Augmentation project </br></br> phase three . </br> </br>The City has initiated an Indirect Potable Reuse Reservoir Augmentation </br>Demonstration Project at North City to determine the feasibility of using advanced water </br></br>treatment on recycled wastewater for augmentation of supplies in a local reservoir. Reservoir </br></br>water would undergo further treatment before being distributed as drinking water; such </br></br>project is not expected to materially affect the Wastewater System in the near future. </br> </br>South Bay Water Reclamation Plant</br>. The South Bay Plant commenced operations in </br>2002. This plant  located on Dairy Mart Road north of the International Border with Tijuana  </br></br>Mexico  is a sewage treatment facility that is capable of processing sewage to both secondary </br></br>and tertiary treatment levels. The South Bay Plant operates under an NPDES permit for the </br></br>treatment and disposal of wastewater through the shared South Bay Ocean Outfall and </br></br>Reclaimed Water Permit No. 2000 203  the “Reclaimed Water Permit”   which authorizes </br></br>water reclamation from the South Bay Plant. The Reclaimed Water Permit  as previously </br></br>amended  is effective until it is revoked. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—General.” </br> </br>Untreated wastewater is pumped to the South Bay Plant’s headworks from the Otay </br>River Pump Station and the Grove Avenue Pump Station  which divert flow from the South </br></br>Metro Interceptor. The South Bay Plant has a permitted capacity of 15 mgd average daily </br></br>flow. For Fiscal Year 2009 the plant operated at an average flowrate of approximately 8.5 </br></br>mgd. The South Bay Plant produced an average of 4.7 mgd of reclaimed water that was </br></br>distributed to users. The South Bay Plant limits its production of reclaimed water to meet </br></br>demand. The South Bay Plant uses a phased tertiary process that allows the tertiary process to </br></br>be bypassed when reclaimed water is not being produced  which increases efficiency and </br></br>reduces plant operations and maintenance cost. Excess treated effluent is discharged to the </br></br>South Bay Ocean Outfall for disposal. See “South Bay Ocean Outfall.” The South Bay Plant </br></br>does not treat its own solids and cannot discharge its solids to the Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center directly. Primary sludge is pumped to the South Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline and </br></br>conveyed to the Point Loma Plant for further treatment and from there to the Metropolitan </br></br>Biosolids Center for processing. See “—Point Loma Plant” and “—Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center.”  </br> </br>The City is seeking to increase use of reclaimed water generated by the South Bay Plant </br>and has entered into an agreement with the Otay Water District pursuant to which the Otay </br></br>Water District may purchase up to 6 mgd of reclaimed water for resale by the Otay Water </br></br>District for landscape irrigation. During Fiscal Year 2009  54% of the treated sewage was </br></br>beneficially reused by the Otay Water District  the International Wastewater Treatment Plant  </br></br>a federally owned and operated treatment facility in the Tijuana River Valley  or used for in </br> 29  </br>plant purposes. During warmer periods of the year  almost the entire amount of wastewater </br>treated at the South Bay Plant is reused. </br> </br>Operations at the South Bay Plant are monitored and controlled from a distributed  </br>computer based control system located in the South Bay Plant’s control center. Local control </br></br>stations are also strategically located around the South Bay Plant and can be used to access </br></br>the entire plant control system. </br> </br>Point Loma Ocean Outfall</br>. The Point Loma Ocean Outfall was constructed in 1963 to </br>provide a method for disposal of all Point Loma Plant effluent. The original capacity of the 2.5 </br></br>mile long  108 inch diameter outfall has been estimated at 390 mgd under the original design </br></br>configuration. The Point Loma Ocean Outfall Extension  a 2.0 mile extension of the original </br></br>outfall  was completed in 1993  resulting in a 4.5 mile long outfall discharging treated sewage </br></br>effluent at an approximate depth of 320 feet of water at the discharge point and a capacity of </br></br>432 mgd. The Point Loma Ocean Outfall uses a Y shaped diffuser to provide for a wide </br></br>dispersal of effluent into the ocean. It is one of the longest  deepest ocean outfalls in the United </br></br>States. The Department believes that the length  depth  design and location of the Point Loma </br></br>Ocean Outfall facilitates protection of ocean water beneficial uses. </br> </br>South Bay Ocean Outfall</br>. The South Bay Ocean Outfall discharges flows from the </br>City’s South Bay Plant and the International Boundary and Water Commission’s International </br></br>Treatment Plant. The South Bay Ocean Outfall consists of a land portion running 3.3 miles </br></br>and an ocean portion discharging 3.5 miles off the coast at a depth of 95 feet. The outfall is </br></br>jointly owned by the City and the International Boundary and Water Commission. The City </br></br>has a 40% ownership interest in the South Bay Ocean Outfall  or approximately 133 mgd of </br></br>the peak flow capacity of 333 mgd.  </br> </br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center</br>.

              " Regulatory Requirements.” Due to the nature of operations at the </br></br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center  the facility employs extensive odor control facilities to treat the </br></br>foul air from the major treatment processes. </br> </br>The Metropolitan Biosolids Center and North City Plant have privatized cogeneration </br>plants which are owned and operated by Minnesota Methane San Diego  LLC  “MMSD”   a </br></br>subsidiary of Fortistar Methane Group  LLC. The City has subleased methane gas rights from </br></br>the adjacent landfill  the “Miramar Landfill”  and the Metropolitan Biosolids Center’s digester </br></br>gas to MMSD  the “Landfill Gas Lease”   which burns the fuel in its cogeneration plants to </br></br>produce electricity and heat. The City has purchase contracts  the “Cogeneration Facility </br></br>Agreements”  with MMSD to buy electricity for operations at the Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center and the North City Plant. The Cogeneration Facility Agreements are scheduled to expire </br></br>in June 2019. Any excess power that is generated is sold by MMSD to the power grid. This </br></br>arrangement allows the Wastewater System  including portions used by the Participating </br></br>Agencies  to decrease its dependence on external sources of power and reduces energy </br></br>expenditures. The Participating Agencies do not receive revenues with respect to the </br></br>Cogeneration Facility Agreements. Under the Landfill Gas Lease and the Cogeneration Facility </br></br>Agreements  the City bears the risk of a possible termination of the Prime Leases. The Prime </br></br>Leases allow the Federal government to terminate such lease in the event the City breaches the </br></br>terms thereof or  in some instances  without breach by the City. If the United States Navy </br></br>terminates the Prime Leases for its convenience  it will owe the City an equitable adjustment of </br></br>the City’s rent on the parcels on which the Miramar landfill and the Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center stand. If the United States Navy terminates the Prime Leases for any reason  then the </br></br>City must purchase MMSD’s facilities  including the landfill gas collection system installed by </br></br>MMSD and the cogeneration plants at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center and the North City </br></br>Plant at a purchase price equal to the greater of a “stipulated purchase price”  provided by </br></br>formula in the contract  which takes into account such factors as initial and depreciated </br></br>values  or the “fair market value” of the facilities  as each of these terms is defined in the </br></br>agreements with MMSD. The maximum amount of exposure to the City for the loss of these </br></br>facilities is estimated to be </br>$38 million. Such a loss would only arise upon the occurrence of a </br>default by the City or termination by the United States Navy for its convenience. The City </br></br>believes that it is unlikely that the United States Navy will terminate the Prime Leases for any </br></br>reason other than an uncured breach by the City or in the event of a national or military </br></br>emergency in part because of the United States Navy’s reliance on the landfill and the City’s </br></br>substantial investments in placing regionally crucial wastewater infrastructure  such as the </br></br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center at Miramar. See “RISK FACTORS—Utility Costs.”  </br> </br>Pump Stations</br>. There are four pump stations that service the Metropolitan Sub </br>System. Two pump stations  Pump Station No. 1 and Pump Station No. 2  began operation in </br></br>1963. A third pump station  the Grove Avenue Pump Station  began operations in 2002 to </br></br>pump wastewater to the South Bay Plant.

The Metropolitan Sub System interceptors consist of two major branches  </br>the South Branch and the North Branch  which meet at Pump Station No. 2. Interceptor </br> 31  </br>capacities are adequate for current peak flows and the City models capacity consistent with all </br>current regulations. Due to capacity limitations at Pump Station No. 2  the Department </br></br>initiated the Wet Weather Storage Facility Project which is expected to be needed by </br>2011 in </br>order to minimize the risk of sewage spills. The Wet Weather Storage Project will include the </br></br>construction of an underground storage tank with a capacity of seven million gallons near </br></br>Pump Station No. 2 to store excess wastewater flow during the peak wet weather flow period </br></br>to relieve the capacity constraint at Pump Station No. 2. An alternative to the Wet Weather </br></br>Storage Facility Project is the Wet Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project which the </br></br>Department is currently studying. The Wet Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project will </br></br>include a study of the feasibility of disposing the tertiary treated reclaimed water from the </br></br>North City Plant to the streams or canyons during the peak wet weather flow period to relieve </br></br>the capacity constraint at Pump Station No. 2. If Department deems that this project is </br></br>feasible  the Wet Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project will require the acquisition of </br></br>an NPDES permit from the Regional Water Board and the modification of existing reclaimed </br></br>water and sewer facilities. The Wet Weather Storage Project can be deferred to </br>2015 if the Wet </br>Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project is implemented. </br> Municipal Sub System Facilities </br> </br>The Municipal Sub System consists of approximately 3 000 miles of trunk and collector </br>mains  79 sewer pump stations  including East Mission Gorge Pump Station  Sewage Pump </br></br>Station No. 64  Sewage Pump Station No. 65  and Penasquitos Pump Station  serving </br></br>approximately 275 000 accounts with connections to the sanitary sewer system. </br></br>Approximately 83% of these connections are from accounts relating to single family dwellings  </br></br>11% are from accounts relating to multifamily dwellings and the remaining 6% are from </br></br>accounts relating to commercial and industrial customers  these percentages include multiple </br></br>accounts at some locations . On average  these accounts generate 109 mgd of wastewater </br></br>which is conveyed by the Municipal Sub System to the Metropolitan Sub System for treatment </br></br>and disposal. The Municipal Sub System also includes 54 permanent flow monitoring stations </br></br>which are utilized for multiple purposes  including strength based billing  facility planning  </br></br>sewer modeling  criticality evaluation  infiltration inflow analysis and spill detection.  </br> Additional Contractual Capacity to the Escondido Plant and the San Elijo Plant </br> </br>The Department does not connect the Rancho Bernardo sewer service area to pipelines </br>within the Municipal Sub System. Pursuant to a sewage disposal agreement with the City of </br></br>Escondido entered into in 1972  up to five mgd of sewage emanating from the Rancho </br></br>Bernardo sewer service area of the City may be treated at Escondido’s Hale Avenue Treatment </br></br>Plant  the “Escondido Plant” . The Escondido Plant is not owned by the City and is not part of </br></br>the Municipal Sub System. This agreement is scheduled to terminate in 2022  fifty years from </br></br>the date on which sewage flow commenced through the Escondido Plant  and may be </br></br>extended at the City’s option for an unlimited number of ten year periods. The Escondido </br></br>Plant  which can process up to 18 mgd of sewage  currently is treating approximately 3 mgd </br></br>of flow from the City. The City of Escondido is considering options to increase its treatment </br></br>capacity to accommodate expected population growth.  </br> </br>Pursuant to a sewage disposal agreement with the Solana Beach Sanitation District </br>entered into in 1974  as amended and supplemented in 1975  the City has the right to connect </br></br>to sewer lines within the Solana Beach Sanitation District. Pursuant to such agreement  the </br></br>City may permit the connection to the Solana Beach Sanitation District of up to 300 EDUs  or </br></br>84 000 gallons per day  of sewage emanating from the portion of the City contiguous to Del </br></br>Mar and Solana Beach may be treated at the San Elijo Water Reclamation Plant  the “San Elijo </br></br>Plant” .

The Wastewater System is in compliance with the major elements of each of the </br></br>foregoing regulations and other programs managed by the Federal government and the State.  </br>  33  </br>In addition to the general compliance mandates under the applicable Federal </br>regulations  the City is subject to the specific requirements of the Final Consent Decree  herein </br>defined  among the U.S. EPA and two environmental groups in connection with sewer spills </br></br>from December 1996 to April 2001. See “—Collection of Sewage—The Municipal Sub System </br></br>Collection System.” To date  the City has met the targets established as part of the Final </br></br>Consent Decree  except for one capital improvement project discussed below. </br> Collection of Sewage </br> </br>General</br>. The Clean Water Act and the NPDES permit system  including the Point </br>Loma Discharge Permit and the South Bay Discharge Permit issued thereunder  set effluent </br></br>limitations on the discharge of pollutants at treatment plants and generally prohibit the </br></br>discharge of pollutants into navigable waterways. Such prohibited discharges from the </br></br>collection system are also subject to injunctive or penalty proceedings by the Regional Water </br></br>Board. </br> </br>The Municipal Sub System Collection System</br>. The Clean Water Act prohibits the </br>discharge of sewer to surface waters  including discharges as a result of sanitary sewer </br></br>overflows  “SSOs”  into the collection system  except as authorized under an NPDES permit. </br></br>The California Water Code has a broader interpretation of SSOs  to include waste discharges </br></br>that could affect the quality of State waters  both surface and groundwater. </br> </br>To provide a consistent  statewide regulatory approach to address SSOs  the State </br>Water Board adopted the Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements for Sanitary Sewer </br></br>Systems  Water Quality Order No. 2006 0003 on May 2  2006  the “Sanitary Sewer Order” . </br></br>The Sanitary Sewer Order requires public agencies that own or operate sanitary sewer systems </br></br>to develop and implement a Sewer System Management Plan  “SSMP”  and report all SSOs to </br></br>the State Water Board’s SSO database. The SSMP must include an operation and maintenance </br></br>program  a current map of the sanitary sewer system  a rehabilitation and replacement plan  a </br></br>training plan and an inventory of equipment and replacement parts. </br> </br>In March 2001  two environmental groups filed suit against the City alleging that the </br>Municipal Sub System’s collection system was deficient as a result of sewer spills which had </br></br>occurred since December 1996. The U.S. EPA and the State filed similar suits against the City </br></br>in July 2003. The resulting settlements were memorialized in a Partial Consent Decree  the </br></br>“Partial Consent Decree”  which expired on June 30  2006 and a Second Partial Consent </br></br>Decree  the “Second Partial Consent Decree”   which expired on June 30  2007. Under the </br></br>Partial Consent Decree and the Second Partial Consent Decree  the City agreed to rehabilitate </br></br>or replace 200 miles of sewer pipeline by June 30  2007. In 2007  the City  the United States  </br></br>the EPA  the environmental groups entered into a final Consent Decree  the “Final Consent </br></br>Decree” and  together with the Partial Consent Decree and the Second Partial Consent Decrees  </br></br>the “Consent Decrees” .  </br> </br>The Final Consent Decree requires  among other things  increased sewer spill response </br>and tracking  increased root control and replacement or rehabilitation of an additional </br>250 </br>miles of pipeline between July 1  2007 and June 30  2013. The Final Consent Decree provides </br></br>that the City will replace or rehabilitate 30 miles of pipeline in Fiscal Year </br>2008  45 miles of </br>pipeline per year from Fiscal Year 2009 to Fiscal Year 2012  and 40 miles of pipeline in Fiscal </br></br>Year 2013. The City has replaced or rehab</br>ilitated approximately 49.48 miles of sewer pipeline  </br>including 4.48 miles banked in Fiscal Year 2009. Between July 1  2009  and January 31  2010  </br></br>the City awarded nine contracts for the completion of an additional 22.20 miles. The </br></br>additional 22.20 miles of pipeline  combined with the 4.48 of banked miles  14.49 of miles </br></br>completed as of December 31  2009  and a projected 3.83 miles from existing contracts  totals </br></br>45 miles of sewer pipeline for Fiscal Year 2010. The City may assert its right to extend the </br> 34  </br>deadline to replace or rehabilitate 45 miles of sewer pipeline during Fiscal Year </br>2010. The Final </br>Consent Decree states that if more than the specified miles of pipeline are replaced  </br>rehabilitated or permanently repaired in one year  the City may apply the excess amount </br></br>against the requirement to replace  rehabilitate  or permanently repair pipeline in any f</br>uture </br>year. In addition  the Final Consent Decree requires an analysis of the feasibility of relocating </br></br>sewer lines out of certain canyons by March 1  2009  which has been completed. Further  the </br></br>Final Consent Decree requires upgrades or replacement of more than 20 pump stations and </br></br>force main upgrades  and court supervision of these upgrades at least through July 2013. The </br></br>costs for bidding  constructing and completing the required work will depend on variables </br></br>such as the cost of materials and labor. No civil penalty payment was required under the </br></br>Consent Decrees. However  the Final Consent Decree provides that the City may be subject  at </br></br>the discretion of the Federal government  to various stipulated penalties for subsequent </br></br>violations of the provisions relating to  among other things  reporting and plan submissions  </br></br>compliance milestone and SSOs. To date  the City has not been subject to any penalties </br></br>resulting from alleged violations of the Final Consent Decree  but the City could be penalized </br></br>for late completion of Sewer Pump Station No. 79  SPS 79 . See APPENDIX A—“BASIC </br></br>FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND </br></br>CERTAIN EXCERPTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF </br></br>THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009.” </br> </br>The Final Consent Decree requires the City to construct improvements to SPS 79. SPS </br>79 has been in operation since 1984. The fac</br>ility is located in the Carmel Valley Pacific </br>Highlands Ranch area on the north side of San Dieguito Road  just east of the intersection of El </br></br>Camino Real and San Dieguito Road. Section VII.C.8 of the Final Consent Decree requires the </br></br>City to replace the pumps and motors  install a properly sized storage tank  complete </br></br>electrical upgrades  improve odor control  add SCADA controls and alarms  and install a </br></br>redundant force main approximately 8 230 feet in length. On September 18  2007  the City </br></br>Council authorized the City to negotiate an agreement with a local developer  Pardee Homes </br></br> Pardee   for the design and construction of upgrades to SPS 79. A future development project </br></br>of Pardee s depends on the improvements to SPS 79. </br> </br>The improvements to SPS 79 were supposed to be completed by December 2009. The </br>City extended the original deadline of December 2008 to December 2009 as permitted by </br></br>section VII.E.1 of the Final Consent Decree. The City does not have the authority under the </br></br>Final Consent Decree to extend the project deadline any further  so the improvements to SPS </br></br>79 became overdue as of January 1  2010. The EPA has the discretion to impose penalties on </br></br>the City for late completion pursuant to Section XI.B of the Final Consent Decree  increasing in </br></br>severity the later the project becomes: </br> </br>1 14 days late $750 day </br></br>15 28 days late $1 500 day </br></br>28 days or more late $3 000 day </br></br> </br>The improvements to SPS 79 are complete  except for punch list items   and SPS 79 </br>was returned to operation on April 6  2010. Based on that date of completion  the EPA could </br></br>penalize the City as much as $235 500. The causes of the delay include a significant re design </br></br>of the project due to improvements the City made upstream of the project to reduce inflow </br></br>and infiltration  bids for construction that were higher than expected  revised environmental </br></br>documents  and problems with delivery of the new pumps.  </br> </br>In addition  under the Final Consent Decree the City may now be penalized by the EPA </br>for SSOs over 1 000 gallons that reached navigable waters while the improvements to SPS 79 </br></br>were late. The City is exempt from EPA penalties for SSOs as long as it is in compliance with </br></br>the Final Consent Decree  but the delayed completion of improvements to SPS 79 temporarily </br> 35  </br>removed the exemption. Since January 1  2010  the City has experienced three SSOs that </br>reached navigable waters. Pursuant to Section XI.D of the Final Consent Decree  the City could </br></br>be penalized up to $6 000for these SSOs: </br> Date</br> Location</br> SSO </br>volume</br> Penalty</br> January 21  2010 </br>6241 Waverly Place </br>5 025 gallons </br>$2 000 </br>January 26  2010 7011 Linda Vista Road </br>1 025 gallons </br>$2 000 </br>February 27  2010 4635 Morena Boulevard 2 520 pallons </br>$2 000 </br> </br>These penalties for SSOs do not include any fines that may be imposed by the San </br>Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board  which is not signatory to the Final Consent </br></br>Decree. See APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  REQUIRED </br></br>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND CERTAIN EXCERPTS FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009.” </br> </br>Based on the Rate Model as of February 1  2010  the estimated average annual cost of </br>the Final Consent Decree for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2013 is $99 m</br>illion for capital projects  </br>including pipeline repair and replacement and $42 m</br>illion  based on the budget for WWC for </br>Fiscal Year 2010  for operations and maintenance  including increased cleaning of Wastewater </br></br>System facilities and funding for video monitoring. Such estimated average annual costs are </br></br>included in the Wastewater System’s budget and the fiscal information set forth in Table 5 and </br></br>Table 17. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM” and </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial Projections.” Some of the </br></br>upgrades required by the Final Consent Decree are under construction. Upgrades required by </br></br>the Final Consent Decree will be financed through the Wastewater System CIP  as described </br></br>under “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM—Background ” </br></br>including with a portion of the proceeds of the Series 2009A Bonds. See “WASTEWATER </br></br>SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS—Capital Improvement Projects—Municipal </br></br>Sub System Projects.” </br> </br>In 2001  the Department initiated a program to reduce SSOs by maintaining a system </br>wide cleaning schedule  video monitoring and assessing the condition of the oldest and most </br></br>problematic sewer lines in the Wastewater System and increasing the number of miles of sewer </br></br>lines replaced or rehabilitated annually. The Department has reduced sewer spills by 90% </br></br>between calendar year 2000 and calendar year 2009. During calendar year 2009  there were 38 </br></br>SSOs in the Municipal Sub System. </br> Treatment of Sewage </br> </br>The Clean Water Act generally requires that all wastewater treatment plants provide </br>secondary treatment for sewage before it is discharged into waterways. The Clean Water Act </br></br>allows wastewater treatment plants to apply for a waiver from the secondary treatment </br></br>standards for certain ocean discharges  a “Treatment Waiver” . The Clean Water Act grants </br></br>the U.S. EPA the discretion to grant or deny any Treatment Waiver. The South Bay Plant </br></br>complies with the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean Water Act and therefore does </br></br>not need a Treatment Waiver to operate. The City operates the Point Loma Plant subject to a </br></br>Treatment Waiver from the U.S. EPA that must be renewed every five years.  </br> </br>The City first applied for a Treatment Waiver for the Point Loma Plant in 1979. In July </br>1988  subsequent to unsuccessful efforts by the City to obtain a Treatment Waiver  the United </br></br>States of America  acting through the Department of Justice and the EPA  and the State sued </br></br>the City for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and the Point Loma Discharge Permit </br></br>due to sewer overflows  failure to meet the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean </br> 36  </br>Water Act and alleged irregularities in the City’s pretreatment program that regulates </br>industrial waste. As a result of this lawsuit  the City paid a penalty of $500 000  enacted a </br></br>low flow toilet ordinance as a credit project  and agreed to a stipulated final order  the “Final </br></br>Order”  that required certain improvements to the Wastewater System  all of which the City </br></br>has completed. The Final Order was eligible for termination on June 30  2003  but has not been </br></br>terminated because additional compliance orders were subsequently issued to address sewer </br></br>spills. See “—Collection of Sewage.” </br> </br>In 1994  at the request of the City  the United States Congress adopted OPRA  </br>amending the Clean Water Act to allow the City to apply for a Treatment Waiver  subject to </br></br>certain conditions. These conditions required  among other things  that the City achieve a </br></br>system capacity of 45 mgd of reclaimed wastewater per day by January 1  2010  remove not </br></br>less than 80% of TSS  on a monthly average  in the discharge of the Point Loma Plant  remove </br></br>not less than 58% of the biochemical oxygen demand  “BOD”   on an annual average  in the </br></br>discharge of the Point Loma Plant  and reduce the quantity of TSS discharged by the </br></br>Wastewater System into the Pacific Ocean during the period of modification. </br> </br>The City applied for and was granted the Point Loma Plant Treatment Waiver on </br>November 9  1995  such Treatment Waiver  granted pursuant to OPRA  is referred to herein as </br></br>a “Modified Permit” . The City must seek a renewal of its Modified Permit every five years if it </br></br>seeks to renew the Point Loma Discharge Permit without implementing secondary treatment. </br></br>The City has satisfied the OPRA requirements to achieve a system capacity of 45 mgd of </br></br>reclaimed wastewater per day by constructing the North City Plant  which has a capacity of 30 </br></br>mgd  and the South Bay Plant  which has a capacity of 15 mgd. The Point Loma Plant has </br></br>consistently met or exceeded the 80% removal requirement for TSS and the 58% removal of </br></br>BOD. The quantity of TSS discharged into the Pacific Ocean has conformed to OPRA </br></br>requirements and all other permit requirements. The City  the U.S. EPA and certain </br></br>environmental groups disagree on how the OPRA requirements may apply to future Modified </br></br>Permits. Currently  there are no active lawsuits or appeals with respect to the OPRA </br></br>requirements. </br> </br>The City filed a renewal application for a Modified Permit and received a Tentative </br>Decision and Tentative Order  the “2002 Tentative Order”  on February 11  2002. Initially  the </br></br>California Coastal Commission objected to the consistency certification submitted by the City </br></br>in connection with its request for a Modified Permit. The California Coastal Commission noted </br></br>three areas of concern that it believed needed to be addressed in order for the discharges to be </br></br>consistent with the applicable California Coastal Management Plan standards:  1  reduction in </br></br>permitted levels of mass emissions;  2  commitments for water reclamation; and  3  additional </br></br>monitoring provisions. Subsequently  the Regional Water Board modified its staff </br></br>recommended permit conditions and  1  reduced the total permitted mass emission loadings; </br></br> 2  requested annual reports from its staff of the City’s progress towards implementing water </br></br>reclamation  which would be independent of the NPDES permit  and noted that it could </br></br>impose future reclamation requirements if adequate progress was not forthcoming; and  3  </br></br>instructed its staff to review and prepare for future adoption by the Regional Water Board </br></br>modifications to the monitoring program  including specific provisions for deep ocean </br></br>receiving stations  human pathogens  and long term trends  which would also be independent </br></br>of the NPDES permit. </br> </br>In separate proceedings  the City successfully appealed the actions of the California </br>Coastal Commission and the Regional Water Board. In May 2002  the City resubmitted its </br></br>consistency certification to the California Coastal Commission and appealed the Commission’s </br></br>consistency certification objection to the Secretary of Commerce. In addition  the City appealed </br></br>the Regional Water Board’s NPDES permit action modifying the mass emission limits to the </br></br>State Water Board. In August 2002  the State Water Board ordered the mass emission limits to </br> 37  </br>be returned to the originally drafted levels. Subsequently  the City resubmitted its consistency </br>certification for the waiver as modified and ordered by the State Water Board. The State Water </br></br>Board concluded that the Regional Water Board had “…failed to make findings  either in its </br></br>order or during its deliberations  that justify reducing the mass emissions limit for TSS…in the </br></br>waste discharge requirements.” The California Coastal Commission then approved the </br></br>consistency certification for the treatment waiver. </br> </br>The City appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board  “EAB”  the provision of the </br>2002 Tentative Order requiring the City to comply with OPRA’s requirements regarding </br></br>reduction of the quantity of TSS discharged by the Wastewater System into the Pacific Ocean </br></br>over the period of modification. Concurrent with the City’s appeal  three environmental groups </br></br>filed challenges to the Modified Permit contesting the maximum discharge limit of TSS and the </br></br>EPA’s interpretation of the OPRA requirements. The City’s challenge and all the challenges </br></br>filed by such environmental groups have been resolved by a Joint Stipulation for Withdrawal </br></br>of Appeals  “Joint Stipulation for Withdrawal of Appeals”  in which the City agreed to </br></br> a  evaluate improved ocean monitoring;  b  pilot test biological aerated filters as a form of </br></br>technology to increase solids removal; and  c  study increased water reuse. The Joint </br></br>Stipulation for Withdrawal of Appeals was approved by the EAB on March 29  2004  and  as </br></br>approved  confirmed the provisions of the current Modified Permit through June 2008 and </br></br>reserved each of the parties’ respective position on OPRA to future permits.  </br> </br>Based upon the Department’s review of its annual biosolids reports from 2003 through </br>2007  the Department determined that the Metropolitan Biosolids Center and Point Loma </br></br>Plant satisfied the criteria for biosolids disposal required by the Clean Water Act and for the </br></br>use or disposal of sewage sludge that includes the analytical results. In December 2007  the </br></br>City submitted an application to the U.S. EPA to request a renewal of the Modified Permit for </br></br>the Point Loma Plant. The City’s renewal application followed the same conventions as </br></br>previous applications relative to OPRA. The U.S. EPA has permitted the City to operate </br></br>pursuant to the existing Modified Permit until it renders a final decision with respect to the </br></br>City’s renewal application because the City filed a renewal application in a timely manner. The </br></br>City received a Tentative Decision and Tentative Order to approve the Modified Permit for an </br></br>additional five years  the “2008 Tentative Order”  from the U.S. EPA on December 2  2008. In </br></br>January 2009  the City Council approved a resolution authorizing the City to negotiate and </br></br>execute an agreement with two local environmental groups regarding the Modified Permit for </br></br>the Point Loma Plant. Pursuant to such agreement  the two environmental groups agreed not </br></br>to challenge the 2008 Tentative Order and the City is obligated to research options to increase </br></br>the use of reclaimed wastewater and decrease discharges to the Pacific Ocean from the Point </br></br>Loma Plant for a total cost not to exceed $2 million. The U.S. EPA and the Regional Water </br></br>Board held an initial  joint hearing in January 2009 to accept public comment on the 2008 </br></br>Tentative Order. In June 2009  the State of California  Regional Water Quality Control Board  </br></br>concurred with the EPA and concluded the public hearing process by unanimously approving </br></br>the modified permit. On October 7  2009 the California Coastal Commission voted 8 to 4 to </br></br>approve the modified permit with the condition that the City come back in 2 years with the </br></br>Recycled Water Study. On March 12  2010  the California Coastal Commission adopted </br></br>findings in support of their action on October 7  2009  and concurred with the consistency </br></br>certification for the proposed waiver. Modified Permits are reviewed by the U.S. EPA every </br></br>five years. See “THE WASTEWATER SYSTEM—Metropolitan Sub System Facilities—Point </br></br>Loma Plant.” </br> </br>Although the City has obtained two successive Modified Permits from the EPA  the </br>City can give no assurances that the U.S. EPA will renew or grant Modified Permits to the City </br></br>in the future. If the City does not obtain a renewal of the Modified Permit  or any subsequent </br></br>Modified Permit   the City may no longer be permitted to continue discharging sewage from </br></br>the Point Loma Plant without complying with the secondary treatment requirements of the </br> 38  </br>Clean Water Act. The City considered two alternatives to address this contingency. One of </br>these contemplates upgrading the Point Loma Plant with conventional secondary treatment </br></br>capabilities. The City also considered  subject to verification of its effectiveness  an alternative </br></br>to implement a new process for treating sewage at the Point Loma Plant that may entail less </br></br>capital but greater maintenance and operation costs. The City could also be required to build </br></br>additional solids processing facilities to reduce the burden at the Point Loma Plant or bring the </br></br>Point Loma Plant into compliance with the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean </br></br>Water Act if the quantity of TSS that the Wastewater System discharges into the Pacific Ocean </br></br>increases above the levels required by OPRA  as finally determined by the EPA. Pursuant to </br></br>the 2002 Tentative Order  a renewed Modified Permit w</br>ill be granted based on  among other </br>things  the continued satisfaction of the conditions established under OPRA  as set forth </br></br>above. </br> </br>The City estimates the cost of the alternatives to bring the Point Loma Plant into </br>compliance with the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean Water Act will be between </br></br>$800 million and $1.5 billion in capital costs  based on Fiscal Year </br>2008 calculations  if the </br>2008 Tentative Order is terminated and the Regional Water Board and U.S. EPA do not </br></br>approve the Modified Permit. The larger amount assumes that  among other things  the City </br></br>cannot access land from the United States Navy or the United States Park Service. Further  in </br></br>the event the waiver is not approved for renewal  the City estimates there would also be an </br></br>increase in operating and maintenance costs of approximately $40 million per year  including </br></br>additional energy and personnel costs  once the Point Loma Plant is fully operational at the </br></br>secondary treatment level. Such estimated costs are not reflected in the financial information </br></br>included in Table 5 and Table 17. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT </br></br>PROGRAM” and “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial </br></br>Projections.” </br> Discharge and Disposal of Sewage </br> </br>Enacted in 1972  the Clean Water Act is a comprehensive revision of prior Federal water </br>pollution control legislation requiring operators of wastewater treatment plants to operate </br></br>such facilities in accordance with NPDES permits which set forth discharge limitations and </br></br>reporting requirements applicable to wastewater treatment facilities. The NPDES permit sets </br></br>effluent limitations on what is discharged into any public waters and prohibits any non </br></br>authorized discharges such as sewer system overflows. The Point Loma Plant and the South </br></br>Bay Plant must each obtain an NPDES permit authorizing them to discharge sewage into the </br></br>ocean because  at present  all of the Wastewater System’s sewage that is discharged into the </br></br>ocean is discharged through either the Point Loma Plant or the South Bay Plant. The Regional </br></br>Water Board adopted Waste Discharge Requirements  “WDR”  for the Point Loma Plant on </br></br>April 10  2002  and authorized the U.S. EPA to issue the Point Loma Discharge Permit in </br></br>conjunction with the renewal of the Point Loma Plant’s NPDES permit for discharge to the </br></br>Pacific Ocean pursuant to the Clean Water Act. The conditions of the WDR were appealed to </br></br>the State Water Board by the City. The final permit was signed by the U.S. EPA Regional </br></br>Administrator on September 13  2002 and became effective on October 16  2002. The Regional </br></br>Water Board approved an addendum to the Point Loma Discharge Permit  “Addendum No. </br></br>1”  on June 11  2003. Addendum No. 1 modified the monitoring and reporting program of the </br></br>Point Loma Discharge Permit to incorporate recommendations of the Southern California </br></br>Coastal Water Research Project’s Model Monitoring Program for Large Ocean Discharges in </br></br>Southern California. The Regional Water Board adopted waste discharge requirements for the </br></br>South Bay Plant on November 8  2006  and authorized the issuance of the South Bay </br></br>Discharge Permit for discharges into the Pacific Ocean. The South Bay Discharge Permit </br></br>became effective January 1  2007 and is scheduled to expire January 1  2012.  </br>  39  </br>In 1993  the U.S. EPA promulgated its “Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage </br>Sludge”  Code of Federal Regulations Title 40  Part 503   which established  among other </br>things  pollutant limitations  operational standards  management practices and other </br></br>provisions intended to protect public health. In addition to Federal requirements  the City </br></br>must also comply with State Water Board adopted Water Quality Order No. 2004 12 DWQ  </br></br>which expands upon Federal regulations with respect to biosolids and streamlines the </br></br>regulatory process for the use of biosolids as a soil amendment.  </br> </br>The City must also comply with effluent water quality based State requirements. The </br>California Water Code Article 4  commencing with Section 13160  of Chapter 3 of Division 7 </br></br>requires the State Water Board to formulate and adopt a water quality control plan for the </br></br>ocean waters of the State known as the California Ocean Plan  the “Ocean Plan” . The Ocean </br></br>Plan sets forth waste discharge limitations and monitoring and enforcement guidelines to </br></br>ensure that water quality objectives are met. Section 303 c  1  of the Clean Water Act and </br></br>Section 13170.2 b  of the State Water Code require that ocean water quality standards be </br></br>reviewed at least once every three years. In the event significant changes to the discharge </br></br>requirement for TSS are approved with respect to the Ocean Plan  future waivers for the Point </br></br>Loma Plant may be threatened. In September  2009  the State Water Resources Control Board </br></br>approved what it characterized as non substantive amendments to the California Ocean Plan </br></br>as part of its Triennial Review. The 2009 amended Ocean Plan is pending approval by the </br></br>Office of Administrative Law. The TSS limitations in Table A of the Ocean Plan are </br></br>unchanged.  </br> </br>The City’s proposed water reclamation projects are subject to the Porter Cologne Water </br>Quality Control Act of 1969  as amended  the “Porter Cologne Act”  and are being designed in </br></br>consultation with State officials to comply with its requirements. The Porter Cologne Act </br></br>directly addresses the issues of water reclamation and reuse. A declared policy of the law is </br></br>the development of facilities to reclaim wastewater to supplement existing surface and </br></br>underground water supplies to meet their water requirements. The law requires the State </br></br>Department of Health Services to establish statewide reclamation criteria for each type of use </br></br>where such use involves public health.  </br> </br>State law AB 939 required the City to divert at least 50% of all solid waste from landf</br>ill disposal by January 1  2000. For calendar year 2009  the City estimates that it diverted </br></br>approximately 99% of biosolids from landfill disposal. Biosolids diversion is an integral part </br></br>of the City’s compliance with AB 939  as biosolids were disposed of in the City’s landf</br>ill during the baseline year used for calculating the diversion rate. The City entered into a </br></br>franchise disposal agreement with a private company pursuant to which the company shall be </br></br>responsible for the disposal of all biosolids generated at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center </br></br>through a combination of land application and alternative daily cover methods for landfill use. </br></br>The City is considering alternative sludge disposal methods to employ in the event regulations </br></br>change in the future. </br> Industrial Wastewater Control Program </br> </br>The Point Loma Discharge Permit  the South Bay Discharge Permit and various Federal </br>regulations require that the City control discharges from the Wastewater System by </br></br>implementing an industrial wastewater control program  an “IWCP” . The Metropolitan Sub </br></br>System has had an IWCP in effect since 1972. The Metropolitan Sub System’s IWCP was </br></br>formally approved by the U.S. EPA in 1983. The Metropolitan Sub System’s IWCP </br></br>administers and enforces Federal general and specific discharge prohibitions  Federal </br></br>categorical pretreatment standards  treatment plant specific local limits and local source </br></br>control programs within the City. The City’s Industrial Waste Ordinance lists Federal general </br></br>and specific prohibitions and authorizes the issuance of permits  which include applicable </br> 40  </br>Federal and local discharge standards. The City’s Industrial Waste Ordinance also authorizes </br>administrative penalties and other enforcement measures in response to permit or ordinance </br></br>violations. The City has entered into inter jurisdictional pretreatment agreements  each  a </br></br>“Pretreatment Agreement” and  collectively  the “Pretreatment Agreements”  with thirteen of </br></br>the Participating Agencies whose sewage is treated by the Department; agreements with the </br></br>remaining two Participating Agencies are being finalized. The Pretreatment Agreements </br></br>specify that each Participating Agency must either implement an equivalent IWCP or </br></br>authorize the City to administer an IWCP in their respective agencies. The City currently </br></br>administers the IWCP in each of the Participating Agencies. Collectively  the IWCP operated </br></br>by the City regulates 1 466 dischargers throughout the Metropolitan Sub System’s tributary </br></br>area. In addition  inspections have determined that an additional 2 191 fac</br>ilities do not require </br>permits at this time. Annual Pretreatment Program audits by the U.S. EPA and the Regional </br></br>Water Quality Control Board have determined that the IWCP is in compliance with Point </br></br>Loma Discharge Permit  South Bay Discharge Permit and Federal program requirements.  </br> Grant and Loan Related Regulatory Requirements </br> </br>The City is subject to regulatory requirements  in addition to those described above  as </br>a condition of receipt of Federal grants received from the EPA  State grants and SRF low </br></br>interest loans under the Clean Water Act for the planning and construction of various </br></br>improvements to the Wastewater System. Among other grant related requirements are </br></br>guidelines concerning planning methodologies  design criteria  construction activities  and the </br></br>operation  maintenance and financing of facilities. </br> </br>In connection with an U.S. EPA grant of approximately $76 million that the City </br>received and used for the construction of the North City Plant and other wastewater projects  </br></br>the grant contained a condition that the City attempt to meet the goal of beneficial reuse of </br></br>25% of the flows treated at the North City Plant by December 31  2003 and 50% by December </br></br>31  2010. The City has d</br>iligently reported its progress and efforts to meet the goals set forth in </br>the grant. The U.S. EPA has acknowledged the City’s good faith efforts toward compliance </br></br>with the beneficial reuse goals set forth in its grant and has not imposed any penalties or </br></br>sanctions under the grant agreement. During Fiscal Year 2009  the \n",

              " achieved beneficial </br></br>reuse of 28% of the flows treated at the North City Plant. The City is continuing to explore </br></br>alternative means to increase reclaimed water use. See “THE WASTEWATER SYSTEM—</br></br>Metropolitan Sub System Facilities—North City Water Reclamation Plant.” </br> </br>As a condition of certain other Federal grants  the State Water Board  as the delegate of </br>the EPA  must approve the sewer service charge structures of the City and the Participating </br></br>Agencies. Such service charge structures require the recovery of annual operations  </br></br>maintenance and replacement costs from users of the system in a proportionate manner </br></br>according to the customer’s level of use. Such factors as volume  infiltration inflow  delivery </br></br>flow rate  and strength of sewage are to be considered for determining proportionate use. </br></br>Sewer service charge rates for all retail users are reviewed periodically and established at a </br></br>level necessary to generate sufficient revenues to recover the annual operations  maintenance </br></br>and replacement costs. Sewer service charge rates for users are established to recognize the </br></br>volume and strength characteristics of wastewater contributed to the Wastewater System. The </br></br>City Council has taken various actions to adjust the Wastewater System’s rate structure  </br></br>including in connection with periodic review of the distribution of cost of services. See </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—City Council Actions Relating to </br></br>Rate Changes.” The City’s rate structure has been approved by the State Water Board and no </br></br>grant funds or costs under grant funded programs have been disallowed based on the nature </br></br>of the rate structures.  </br> </br>  41  </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM </br> Background </br> The Department prepares an 11 year Wastewater System CIP  consisting of the current </br>budget year and a 10 year projection  on an annual basis  and the City incorporates the first </br></br>year of such plan into the Wastewater System’s annual budget. The EPM of the Department </br></br>also prepares a 25 year internal Wastewater System CIP model in connection with the </br></br>consideration of longer term projects. The Wastewater System CIP presents the total estimated </br></br>project cost since project inception  including expenditures  encumbrances  continuing </br></br>appropriations  the annual budget for the current fiscal year and projections of expenses in </br></br>subsequent years. The general objectives of the Wastewater System CIP are to meet Federal </br></br>and State requirements and City policy regarding water pollution control  to provide </br></br>satisfactory levels of service to users of the Wastewater System  and to maintain the integrity </br></br>of the Wastewater System.  </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP is an ongoing capital expenditure program. During the </br>1990’s  the City completed several large wastewater treatment plant projects in response to </br></br>litigation involving violations of the Clean Water Act. Beginning in 2000  the focus of the </br></br>Wastewater System CIP shifted to the Municipal Sub System. In April 2002  the City received </br></br>an Administrative Order from the U.S. EPA directing the City to prepare and submit a plan </br></br>for rehabilitation and replacement of sewer pipes and structures. In October </br>2007  the City </br>signed the Final Consent Decree with the EPA  which obligates the City to replace or </br></br>rehabilitate </br>250 miles of sewer pipeline between July 2007 and June 2013 and to replace or </br>rehabilitate a number of trunk sewers and pump stations by certain dates. See </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Collection of Sewage—The </br></br>Municipal Sub System Collection System.” </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP includes annual allocations projects  which are </br>programmed expenditures that allow the City to plan for the expansion  renovation  relocation  </br></br>or replacement of facilities and equipment that have reached or exceeded their anticipated </br></br>service life  provides for emergency and accelerated construction needs  and provides for </br></br>capital improvement project contingency needs. Any amount not allocated to a component </br></br>task in a particular year is returned to the contributing fund. In addition  the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP includes phased funding to accommodate  appropriate and contract for large </br></br>projects to maximize the City’s use of available funds by identifying defined portions or </br></br>phases of projects on a contingent basis. The Wastewater System CIP also uses split funding  </br></br>which allows two different revenue sources to be used to fund a capital project on a </br></br>percentage basis. </br> </br>Any ongoing project under the Wastewater System CIP  other than an annual </br>allocation  that was initiated prior to the current Fiscal Year will have expenditures  </br></br>encumbrances or continuing appropriations in the current Fiscal Year. The Department may </br></br>budget additional funding for such projects during current and future Fiscal Years depending </br></br>upon project scheduling. The Department includes the amounts it has budgeted for each Fiscal </br></br>Year in an annual appropriation ordinance  each  an “Annual Appropriation Ordinance”   </br></br>which becomes effective upon adoption by the City Council. Each Annual Appropriation </br></br>Ordinance authorizes the City to appropriate revenues for expenditures relating to capital </br></br>improvement projects for the applicable Fiscal Year. In addition  each Annual Appropriation </br></br>Ordinance provides guidance regarding the administration of the Wastewater System CIP. </br></br>Modifications to a project’s budget may occur during the course of the Fiscal Year through </br></br>City Council action. Appropriations for projects which are contained in the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP for the Fiscal Year 2010 have been approved in the Annual Appropriation </br> 42  </br>Ordinance for the Fiscal Year 2010. However  the City is not obligated to expend funds based </br>on any projections made for Fiscal Years 2011 to 2020 because such projections are not </br></br>contained within the Annual Appropriation Ordinance. </br> </br>The Department currently expects that approximately 80% of the costs of the </br>Wastewater System CIP will be funded with the proceeds of debt financing and the remaining </br></br>20% will be paid on a pay as you go basis from Net System Revenues. Table 5 sets forth the </br></br>Wastewater System CIP for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014 and the expected allocations </br></br>between the Municipal Sub System and Metropolitan Sub Systems.  </br> TABLE 5 </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br>PROJECTED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM EXPENDITURE SUMMARY</br> 1  Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Expected Projects </br>2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 TOTAL </br>Municipal Sub System Projects       </br>      Trunk Sewers </br>$14 214 $ 45 511 $ 47 433 $ 22 919 $ 27 718 $157 795 </br>      Pipelines </br>40 743 51 857 68 770 77 571 60 356 299 297 </br>      Pump Stations </br>10 725 13 722 6 010 6 819 943 38 219 </br>      Miscellaneous </br>0 </br>0 0 0 1 885 </br>1 885 </br>Subtotal Municipal Sub System Projects $65 682 </br>$111 090 </br>$122 213 </br>$107 309 </br>$ 90 902 </br>$497 196 </br>       </br>Metropolitan </br>Sub System </br>Projects       </br>      Treatment Plants </br>$ 2 379 $ 13 449 $ 36 029 $ 27 156 $ 14 049 $ 93 062 </br>      Pipelines </br>0 0 0 0 0 0 </br>      Large Pump Stations </br>3 337 6 401 1 157 3 088 7 584 21 567 </br>      Miscellaneous </br>3 487 </br>5 056 </br>6 281 </br>5 677 </br>5 315 </br>25 816 </br>Subtotal Metropolitan Sub System Projects 9 203 </br>24 906 </br>43 467 </br>35 921 </br>26 948 </br>140 445 </br>TOTAL </br>$74 885 </br>$135 996 </br>$165 680 </br>$143 230 </br>$117 850 </br>$637 641 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department  City of San Diego; Reflects Rate Case as of February 1  </br>2010. </br> 1  Includes an assumed 3.5 percent annual increase in Wastewater System CIP project costs for Fiscal Years 2012 </br>through 2014.

The following is a summary description of certain </br>projects identified in the Wastewater System CIP to be constructed for the Municipal Sub </br></br>System  including Annual Allocation projects in all of these categories. </br> </br>1. Trunk Sewers—These projects include replacement or rehabilitation of existing </br>trunk sewers  larger than 15 inches in diameter  due to deterioration or </br></br>insufficient capacity.  </br> </br>2. Pipelines—These projects include replacement or rehabilitation of various sewer </br>mains located throughout the City due to deterioration or insufficient capacity. </br> </br>3. Pump Stations—These projects include upgrades  renovations  restoration and </br>replacement of major equipment at the Municipal Sub System’s pump stations.  </br> </br>4. Miscellaneous—Other municipal projects such as developer projects. </br></br>  43  </br>Metropolitan Sub System</br>. The following is a summary description of certain projects </br>identified in the Wastewater System CIP to be constructed for the Metropolitan Sub System  </br>including annual allocation projects in the majority of these categories. </br> </br>1. Treatment Plants—These projects include renovations or upgrades at the North </br>City Plant  the South Bay Plant  the Metropolitan Biosolids Center and the Point </br></br>Loma Plant to implement operating efficiencies  optimize the existing facilities </br></br>and comply with revised regulatory and operation plan requirements.  </br> </br>2. Pipelines—These projects include replacement or rehabilitation of various sewer </br>interceptors which are deteriorating or have insufficient capacity. </br> </br>3. Large Pump Stations—These projects include upgrades  renovations  </br>restoration and replacement of major equipment for Metropolitan System Pump </br></br>Stations  Pump Station No. 1 and Pump Station No. 2. </br> </br>4. Miscellaneous—These projects include  among other things  projects for </br>improvements to the Facilities Distributed Controls System  the Environmental </br></br>Monitoring and Technical Services Lab  management of wet weather flows  the </br></br>Metropolitan Facilities Control System Upgrade  which includes upgrades to the </br></br>distributed controls system at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  Point Loma </br></br>Plant  North City Plant and South Bay Plant and Phase I of the Weather Storage </br></br>Facility  which will implement intermittent stream discharge of reclaimed water </br></br>from the North City Plant during heavy rain to reduce the capacity demand on </br></br>the downstream sewer system. </br> Capital Improvement Financing Plan </br> </br>Table 6 below sets forth the projected sources and uses of funds for the Wastewater </br>System CIP for the Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014. New bond issues are assumed to be bonds </br></br>secured by Installment Payments that are Parity Obligations. The amount of Installment </br></br>Payments securing Parity Obligations may decrease if any of the new bond issues are not </br></br>issued as Parity Obligations. Subject to final approval by the State Water Board in Fiscal Year </br></br>2010 the City w</br>ill incur an additional Parity Obligation in the form of the Additional SRF Loan </br>of $46.4 m</br>illion. The potential receipt of the Additional SRF Loan is not included in the City’s </br>Rate Model. However  the receipt of such funds is not expected to affect the overall projections </br></br>because the Department will reduce its aggregate borrowing by a like amount for the period </br></br>covered by its Rate Model. The State is currently reviewing an application for an additional </br></br>SRF Loan of $80 m</br>illion for pipe rehabilitation with a response anticipated in early Fiscal Year </br>2011. </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP includes the costs of the projects described in Table 5 </br>above. The 2010 Adopted Department Budget continues to focus the Wastewater System CIP </br></br>on the annual appropriations  which include  among other things  the replacement of sewer </br></br>mains  pipeline repair and rehabilitation  and upgrades to trunk sewers and pump stations as </br></br>required by the Consent Decree. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—Collection of Sewage.” In the event the City fails to obtain successive </br></br>Modified Permits or if the City fails to obtain clarification of OPRA in its favor  whether by </br></br>judicial or legislative means   the capital costs of the Wastewater System CIP could increase </br></br>substantially. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Treatment </br></br>of Sewage.” If the City is obligated to incur greater costs in repairing and rehabilitating the </br></br>Municipal Sub System than the City projects herein  the capital costs of the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP could increase substantially.

Under CEQA  a project which may have a significant effect on the </br></br>environment and which is to be carried out or approved by a public agency must comply with </br></br>a comprehensive environmental review process  including the preparation of an Environmental </br></br>Impact Report  “EIR” . An EIR reflects not only an independent technical analysis of the </br></br>project’s potential impacts  but also the comments of other agencies with some form of </br></br>jurisdiction over the project and the comments of interested members of the public. Contents </br></br>of an EIR include a detailed statement of the project’s potentially significant environmental </br></br>effects; any such effects which cannot be avoided if the project is implemented; mitigation </br></br>measures proposed to eliminate or minimize such effects; alternatives to the proposed project; </br></br>and any significant irreversible environmental changes which would result from the project. If </br></br>an agency determines that the project itself will not have a significant effect on the </br></br>environment  it may adopt a written statement  called a “Negative Declaration”  to that effect </br></br>and need not prepare an EIR. A Mitigated Negative Declaration  “MND”  is appropriate for </br></br>projects that could potentially result in a significant environmental impact  but revisions or </br></br>standard mitigation measures are incorporated into the project that clearly mitigate the </br></br>impact. Statutory exemptions are activities that are not subject to CEQA. Wastewater System </br></br>CIP projects can also be exempted if they fit a specific “category” of activities identified by the </br></br>State Legislature. Once an agency approves or determines to carry out a project  either </br></br>following an EIR process or after adopting a negative declaration  it must file a notice of such </br> 45  </br>determination. Any action or proceeding challenging the agency’s determination must be </br>brought within 30 days following the filing of such notice. </br> </br>As part of its regular planning and budgetary process  the City prepares in accordance </br>with local  State and Federal law and regulations separate environmental documents for each </br></br>Wastewater System CIP project and evaluates the project under the City’s environmental </br></br>impact review procedures  which were developed in compliance with State law and </br></br>regulations. The City requires that all environmental documents and evaluations be completed </br></br>prior to any authorization of funding for construction by the City Council and the Mayor. </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP involves replacement  upgrading and increasing capacity </br>of existing facilities. Accordingly  the City does not believe that environmental considerations </br></br>will adversely affect the completion of the Wastewater System CIP within the contemplated </br></br>budget or the current timetable.  </br> Project Management for the Wastewater System Capital Improvement Program </br> </br>The Department and the Engineering and Capital Projects Department  “E&amp;CP”   </br>which is a department within the City’s Public Works Group  are responsible for the </br></br>implementation of the Wastewater System CIP. The Department is responsible for selecting the </br></br>projects that are included in the Wastewater Capital Improvement Program. Selection of such </br></br>projects involves  among other things  assessing conditions  sewer modeling  preparing </br></br>planning reports  prioritizing projects  scheduling and allocating the budget. Once the </br></br>Department determines that a particular project should proceed  the Department sends a </br></br>scope of work  planning report or 10% design  as appropriate  and the proposed schedule and </br></br>budget to E&amp;CP. E&amp;CP is responsible for the design  construction and start up of all </br></br>Wastewater System CIP projects.  </br> </br>Each Fiscal Year  the Department and E&amp;CP enter into a Service Level Agreement </br> each  an “SLA”  which outlines the responsibilities of each department as it relates to the </br></br>planning  design and construction of sewer improvements with respect to sewer mains  trunk </br></br>sewers  pump stations and treatment plants. Pursuant to the SLA  E&amp;CP provides engineering </br></br>services including project management  design  environmental  permitting  land acquisition  </br></br>scheduling  budget and construction management. E&amp;CP implements the Wastewater System </br></br>CIP from design of projects to completion  including capitalization of the final asset and </br></br>management of warranty issues  as directed by the Department. The Department provides </br></br>overall direction and policy for planning  financing  and operations and maintenance of the </br></br>Wastewater System. Further  the Department funds the positions and non personnel expenses  </br></br>which are necessary for the service provider of a particular project to fulfill its responsibilities.  </br> Contract Disputes </br> </br>From time to time  the City is engaged in disputes with the contractors and </br>subcontractors working on the Wastewater System CIP. As of January 4  2010  there are no </br></br>pending contract disputes with vendors or contractors working on the Wastewater System CIP </br></br>in excess of $1 million. </br> Insurance for Construction </br> </br>The City requires the consultant or contractor selected to design or construct a </br>Wastewater System CIP project to provide minimum insurance therefor. Design consultants </br></br>are required to provide at a minimum commercial general liability insurance of $1 million per </br></br>occurrence  $2 million aggregate   commercial auto liability insurance of $1 million per </br></br>occurrence  workers’ compensation insurance of $1 million  architect and engineer’s </br> 46  </br>professional liability insurance of $1 million per occurrence  $2 million aggregate  and errors </br>and omissions insurance for design build projects. Construction contractors are required to </br></br>provide at a minimum  among other things  commercial and general liability insurance </br></br>aggregate limit of $2 million  other than products completed operations  and $2 million </br></br> products completed operations   personal injury insurance of $1 million each occurrence  </br></br>commercial automobile liability insurance of $1 million combined single limit per accident  and </br></br>contractors builders risk property insurance in an amount equal to 115% of the contract value. </br></br>Further  depending upon the size and scope of a project  the City’s Risk Management </br></br>Department may require increased insurance coverage at any time and from time to time </br></br>based upon its assessment of the degree of risk for such project. </br> </br> WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS </br> General </br> </br>The Department manages and operates the Wastewater System with funds derived </br>primarily from service charges which are deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund. The Sewer </br></br>Revenue Fund was established in 1956. Funds in the Sewer Revenue Fund are used for the </br></br>operation  maintenance and capital improvement of the Metropolitan Sub System and the </br></br>Municipal Sub System. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—</br></br>Establishment  Calculation and Collection of Sewer Service Charges.”  </br> </br>The primary sources of moneys deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund are derived from </br>revenues generated by sewer service charges to City residents and commercial enterprises  </br></br>capacity charges on new  additional or larger connections to the Wastewater System within the </br></br>City  revenues from the Participating Agencies pursuant to the Regional Sewage Disposal </br></br>Agreement and interest income on fund balances. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL </br></br>OPERATIONS—Participating Agencies; Regional Wastewater Disposal Agreement; </br></br>Transportation Agreements.” The City also deposits into the Sewer Revenue Fund revenues </br></br>received from the United States Navy pursuant to “Department of the Navy Negotiated Water </br></br>and Sewage Contract” by and between the City and United States Navy. </br> Budgetary Process </br> </br>The City budgets revenues and expenditures to support the costs the Department </br>incurs to operate and maintain the Wastewater System. Each April  the Mayor submits the </br></br>Department’s budget for the following fiscal year to the City Council for approval. Budget </br></br>estimates for the Wastewater System CIP are prepared based upon the needs of the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System and the Municipal Sub System. Cost information and schedules </br></br>provided by the design and operations staff are used to prepare the capital budget for the </br></br>Wastewater System. The Department prepares an 11 year Wastewater System CIP each year </br></br>as part of its internal budget process. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL </br></br>IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM—Background.” The Wastewater System CIP consists of </br></br>anticipated costs and a schedule for projects planned for completion and is based on planning </br></br>information from prior years  progress toward stated goals and objectives  future and long </br></br>term needs and planning information developed during the Wastewater System CIP planning </br></br>cycle. The Wastewater System CIP provides the basis for review of the annual budget for the </br></br>Wastewater System CIP and near term projects and is divided into projects for each of the </br></br>Municipal Sub System and the Metropolitan Sub System to address their respective </br></br>requirements. </br>  47  </br>The City commissions a wastewater cost of service  rate design and capacity fee study </br>periodically. The goal of each study is to develop recommendations for the establishment of </br>fair and equitable sewer rates for the City’s users and a revenue program that will be </br></br>acceptable to the State Water Board. Each study includes a review of the City’s financial plan </br></br>or rate case  usage characteristics  and rate structure. The City expects to commission the next </br></br>wastewater cost of service study in calendar year 2011. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Calculation and Collection of Capacity Charges.”  </br> Establishment  Calculation and Collection of Sewer Service Charge Revenue and </br></br>Treatment Plant Services Revenue </br> </br>Sewer Service Charge Revenue</br>. The City deposits sewer service charge revenues  which are </br>primarily derived from sewer service charges to City residents and commercial enterprises into </br></br>the Sewer Revenue Fund. Sewer service charges to City utility customers are collected on a </br></br>municipal bill  which also includes water charges and storm drain fees. Bills are rendered on a </br></br>bi monthly basis for single family and most multifamily dwellings and on a monthly basis for </br></br>industrial  commercial  and large multifamily dwellings. In accordance with the provisions of </br></br>the City Municipal Code  these funds are administered in an enterprise account separate from </br></br>the City’s General Fund. </br> </br>The City establishes fees based upon the costs incurred by the City to collect  treat and </br>discharge wastewater and pay for required capital improvements.

City of </br>San Diego</br>  a class action lawsuit filed on June 16  2004 on behalf of all single family residential </br>account holders in the City’s Municipal Sub System who held sewer accounts during any </br></br>period between May 23  1994 through September 30  2004. The lawsuit alleged the City failed </br> 50  </br>to include a COD cost component in the rate structure during the aforementioned period  </br>which led to overcharges on residential sewer fees that were disproportionate to the cost of </br></br>service attributable to the parcel or land on which service was provided  as required by Article </br></br>XIIID  Section 6 b  3  of the California State Constitution. See “CONSTITUTIONAL </br></br>LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—California </br></br>Constitution Articles X</br>IIIC and XIIID.” The lawsuit also included a claim for breach of </br>contract based on the receipt of Federal and State grants requiring a strength based revenue </br></br>structure.  </br> </br>In 2007  the City settled the </br>Shames </br>case  the “Shames Settlement”  and agreed to </br>reimburse certain “eligible” single family residential customers in the aggregate amount of </br></br>$35 million and to pay attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs’ counsel in the amount of $5 million. </br></br>The City adopted a COD cost component in its rate structure on June 8  2004  pursuant to </br></br>City Council Resolution R 299322  which was implemented on October 1  2004. As part of the </br></br>Shames Settlement  the City also agreed to permit an independent and qualified 501 c  3  non </br></br>profit organization to place a solicitation insert into billing statements for single family </br></br>residential account holders up to three times a year for five years. The billing inserts are </br></br>designed to allow the organization to raise funds for the hiring and payment of experts who </br></br>will review and evaluate the City’s future sewer rate setting activities. To satisfy the terms of </br></br>the Shames Settlement  the City temporarily increased existing sewer rates for all City sewer </br></br>customers by 3.05% on November 1  2007 and increased existing sewer rates by an additional </br></br>3.05% on May 1  2008. For “eligible” single family residential sewer customers  the City w</br>ill reverse the two 3.05% rate increases applicable to all City sewer customers and pay the </br></br>settlement obligation in the form of a monthly credit which is estimated to be $3.25 per month. </br></br>Per the Shames Settlement  “eligible” single family residential customers are those who </br></br>received sewer service to their property in the ten year period prior to October 1  2004. The rate </br></br>reversal and monthly credit for single family residential customers will end and the City will </br></br>terminate the two 3.05% rate increases attributable to the Shames Settlement when the $40 </br></br>million settlement amount has been raised and distributed according to the Shames </br></br>Settlement. The City expects this to occur for all single family residential customers in the fall </br></br>of 2011.

City of San Diego</br>  was filed against the City alleging that until </br>October 2004  when the City revised its sewer rate structure—See footnote  4    single family residential </br></br>customers were overcharged for sewer service  while other customers were undercharged. On May 18  2007  the </br>Superior Court for the County of San Diego approved an agreement to settle the lawsuit. This requires the City to </br></br>reimburse “eligible” single family residential customers a total of $40 m</br>illion  less $5 million for attorney’s </br>fees and other costs  over the next four years.  </br> Accounts Receivable </br> Typically  the City seeks to collect unpaid bills by:  i  issuing an initial shut off notice </br>25 days after a bill is issued;  ii  issuing a final shut off notice 38 days after a bill is issued; </br></br>and  iii  shutting off the customer’s water service 45 51 days after a bill is issued. This </br></br>procedure results in almost all past due bills being paid. If necessary  the City establishes time </br></br>payments for customers who are unable to pay a past due amount. Accounts closed with an </br></br>amount due and unpaid are referred to the City Treasurer for collection activities 75 days after </br></br>the bill is issued but unpaid. An allowance is taken each Fiscal Year for accounts receivable </br></br>that are not expected to be paid. During the Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009  accounts </br></br>receivable amounts outstanding for more than 120 days ranged from approximately $1.6 </br></br>million to approximately $2.6 million. Sewer service charges to City utility customers are </br></br>collected on the municipal sewer bill  which also includes water charges and storm drain fees. </br></br>Bills are currently invoiced every two months for single family dwellings and most multifamily </br></br>dwellings and on a monthly basis for all other customers. </br>  52  </br>Table 10 below sets forth information related to accounts receivable and number of </br>shut offs. </br> TABLE 10 </br>WASTEWATER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHUT OFFS </br> $ In Thousands  </br>For Fiscal Years 2005 to 2009 </br>   2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Sewer Service Revenue </br> 1 </br> $283 423 $286 416 $299 736 $325 048 $318 474 </br>Accounts Receivable</br> 2 </br> 421 157 $18 881 $21 541 $21 101 $20 112 </br>Accounts Receivable Over 120 </br>Days</br> 2  3 </br> $1 639 $2 557 $2 485 $2 193 $2 567 </br>Number of Shut Offs</br> 4 </br> 24 459 21 230 20 451 22 420 23 650 </br>    Sources: Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports for the indicated years for Sewer Service Revenue; Public Utilities </br>Department  City of San Diego  for all other line items. </br> 1  Audited. </br> 2  Excludes amounts payable by Participating Agencies. </br> 3   Estimated. </br> 4  Information provided by the Customer Information System does not differentiate between water and sewer </br>shut offs.

Capacity </br></br>fees are not treated as operating income for financial reporting purposes but are considered </br></br>System Revenues  deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund  and included in the calculation of </br></br>debt service coverage. Pursuant to State law  capacity fees are applied only to capital </br></br>expansion  bonds  contracts  or other indebtedness of the Wastewater System related to </br></br>expansion. Capacity fees are primarily collected on new construction within the City and </br></br>revenues therefrom vary based upon construction activity. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial Projections” below for a schedule of projected </br></br>capacity charges for the Municipal Sub System. </br>  53  </br>Table 11 below sets forth the Sewer Revenue Fund’s EDUs and Capacity Charge </br>Revenues for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 11 </br>MUNICIPAL SUB SYSTEM </br>SEWER UTILITY FUND  </br>HISTORICAL CAPACITY CHARGE REVENUES </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Fiscal Year </br>Equivalent  </br>Dwelling Units</br> 1 </br> Capacity Charge </br>Revenues</br> 2 </br> 2005 4 772 $14 665 </br>2006 5 150 $16 565 </br>2007 3 </br> 4 966 $16 610 </br>2008 3 492 $11 851 </br>2009 4 </br> 2 651 $10 361 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department and the Comptroller’s Office  City of San Diego. </br> 1  Unaudited. Declining number of EDUs reflects a decline in new construction. </br> 2  Unaudited supplemental information provided by the Comptroller’s Office  City of San Diego. </br> 3  From Fiscal Year 2006 to Fiscal Year 2007  the EDUs decreased while the capacity charge revenues increased </br>due to the increase in capacity charge from $3 710 to $4 124 in Fiscal Year 2007 pursuant to City Council </br>Resolution No. R 302378. </br> 4  Amount for Fiscal Year 2009 includes a one time payment for 1 432 EDUs resulting in Capacity Charge revenue </br>of $5.9 million from the City’s General Fund in connection with the City’s Convention Center dewatering project. </br> The City Council reviews capacity charges on a periodic basis. In June 1996  in response </br>to a request by the City Manager to reduce sewer capacity charges in order to stimulate </br></br>economic development and affordable housing  the City Council approved  retroactive to April </br></br>22  1996  a 64% reduction of sewer capacity charges. On June 8  2004  the City Council </br></br>adopted a revised rate structure based on a full cost recovery analysis which increased the </br></br>sewer capacity charge effective July 1  2004 to $3 710 per unit  which was a 48% increase from </br></br>the then existing sewer capacity charge.  </br> </br>Pursuant to State Water Board guidelines and City policy  the City must use a fair and </br>equitable apportioning of costs based on each user class’ contributions of flow and strength of </br></br>wastewater pollutants discharged. The Participating Agencies are billed based on their </br></br>contribution of flow  TSS and COD per the terms outlined in the respective service contracts  </br></br>which were reviewed and approved by the State Water Board in 1998. In calendar year 2003  </br></br>the City commissioned a cost of service study to design a system of user charges for the City’s </br></br>wastewater service consistent with the State Water Board’s revenue guidelines and City </br></br>policies. This study indicated that changes to the City’s existing sewer capacity charge for </br></br>single family residential customers and multifamily customers in the magnitude of the July 1  </br></br>2004 sewer capacity charge increase referenced above would be required to fully recover the </br></br>costs associated with providing additional facility capacity to new users and existing users </br></br>requiring additional capacity. In October 2006  the City commissioned an additional ut</br>ility </br>cost of service study and rate design study for the Department in order to review revenue </br></br>requirements and cost of service allocations  and to confirm that the City’s system of user </br></br>charges for the City’s wastewater service remained consistent with the State Water Board’s </br></br>revenue guidelines and City policies. The resulting report estimated a full cost recovery </br></br>capacity fee of $4 124 per EDU. On February 26  2007  the City Council adopted a revised rate </br></br>structure based on a full cost recovery analysis which increased the sewer capacity charge </br></br>effective May 1  2007 to $4 124  which is an 11% increase from the prior sewer capacity charge.  </br>  54  </br>Table 12 below summarizes the rate history of sewer capacity charges since July 1  </br>1991. </br> TABLE 12 </br>RATE HISTORY FOR SEWER CAPACITY CHARGES </br> Effective Date </br>Sewer Capacity  </br>Charges  Per Unit  </br>% Change </br>July 1  1991 </br>$4 484 </br>16% July 1  1992 </br>$5 201 </br>16 July 1  1993 </br>$6 033 </br>16 July 1  1994 </br>$6 998 </br>16 April 22  1996</br> 1  </br>$2 500  64  </br>July 1  2004</br> 2  </br>$3 710 48 </br>May 1  2007</br> 3  </br>$4 124 11 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department  City of San Diego. </br> 1  Capacity charge decreases to $2 500 pursuant to City Council Resolution No. R 287543 to encourage building </br>activity. </br> 2  Capacity charge increases to $3 710 pursuant to City Council Resolution No. R 299321 based on results of the </br>Cost of Service Study. </br> 3  Capacity charge increases to $4 124 pursuant to City Council Resolution No. R 302378 dated February 26  2007 </br>based on results of the Cost of Service Study. </br> Table 13 below sets forth the projected capacity charges for the Fiscal Years 2010 </br>through 2014.

Certain of the </br>following information in connection with the financial condition and results of operations of the </br></br>City Sewer Revenue Fund for Fiscal Year 2009 is unaudited and should be read in conjunction </br></br>with certain of the information contained in APPENDIX A—BASIC FINANCIAL </br></br>STATEMENTS  REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND CERTAIN </br></br>EXCERPTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY </br></br>OF SAN DIEGO FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009 ” and  specifically  the </br></br>portion of the basic financial statements relating to the operation of the Sewer Revenue Fund.  </br> </br>Operating Revenues</br>. Total operating revenues for Fiscal Year 2009 were $322.6 m</br>illion  </br>which represented a decrease of $5.5 million from total operating revenues in Fiscal Year </br>2008. </br></br>The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in treatment plant services for others of $23 </br></br>million for prior year refunds and reduced billings  offset by an increase in service charge </br></br>revenues of $16.5 m</br>illion. </br> </br>Operating Expenses</br>. Total operating expenses for Fiscal Year 2009 were $267.3 m</br>illion  a </br>decrease of $5.5 million from Fiscal Year </br>2008. Such decrease was the combined result of a </br>decrease in administrative expenses of $19.9 m</br>illion  an increase in maintenance and </br>operations of $9.0 million  and an increase in depreciation of $5.4 million. Administrative </br></br>expenses during Fiscal Year 2009 include long range strategic planning  policy  information </br></br>systems  and general and administrative expenses. Such expenses represented 27% of total </br></br>operating expenses. </br> </br>Maintenance and Operations expenses include expenses for three treatment plants  two </br>of which are water reclamation plants  and a biosolids center. Operation and Maintenance </br></br>costs were 45% of Operating Expenses and totaled $119.5 m</br>illion for Fiscal Year </br>2009. This </br>increase of $9.0 million was 8% greater than the corresponding amount for Fiscal Year </br>2008  </br>due to reclassifying approximately $5 million of administrative expenses  and approximately </br></br>$3 million of increased chemical expenses due to new regulations at the Point Loma </br></br>Wastewater Treatment Plant. </br> </br>Non Operating Revenues</br>. Non operating revenues for Fiscal Year 2009 decreased by $3.6 </br>million from non operating revenues received in Fiscal Year </br>2008. This decrease was primarily </br>due to a decrease in interest earnings of $4.3 million  and an increase in other revenue of $.7 </br></br>million. </br> </br>Non Operating Expenses</br>. Non operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million to </br>$49.7 </br>million during Fiscal Year </br>2009. The decrease was due to a $1.5 m</br>illion increase in losses </br>attributable to the sale or retirement of capital assets and a decrease in debt service interest </br></br>expense of $2.4 million. </br> </br>Reserves</br>. As of June 30  2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had total reserves of </br>$81.1 m</br>illion  </br>which included the amounts in the Rate Stabilization Fund  Operating Reserve  Appropriated </br></br>Reserve  Dedicated Reserve for Efficiency and Savings  the “DRES”  and Wastewater System </br></br>Capital Improvement Program Reserve. As of January 31  2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had </br>total reserves of $85.3 m</br>illion. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—</br>Rate Stabilization Fund and Other Reserves.” </br> </br>Outstanding Obligations</br>. As of June 30  2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had outstanding </br>Obligations in the principal amount of $1.339 b</br>illion. Following the issuance of the Series </br>2010A Bonds  the Department w</br>ill have outstanding Obligations in the principal amount of </br>$1 319 441 099. See “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2010A </br> 57  </br>BONDS—Outstanding Obligations” and APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009 ” including certain information regarding the </br></br>Department’s debt service coverage ratio requirements. </br> Rate Stabilization Fund and Other Reserves </br></br> The City has established accounts within the Sewer Utility Fund for five reserve funds: </br>the Rate Stabilization Fund  “Rate Stabilization Fund”   the Operating Reserve  “Operating </br></br>Reserve”   the Wastewater System Capital Improvement Program Reserve  “Capital </br></br>Improvement Reserve”   the Appropriated Reserve  “Appropriated Reserve”  and the DRES. </br></br>The Department operates these reserve funds in accordance with the City’s fiscal reserve policy </br></br> the “Fiscal Reserve Policy” . The City’s goals with respect to the Fiscal Reserve Policy are to </br></br>provide adequate cash balances to ensure that the City meets its cash flow obligations  </br></br>maximizes earnings on investments  minimizes borrowing costs and maintains the highest </br></br>credit on its bonds and financial obligations. In the event amounts contained in a particular </br></br>reserve are below the anticipated reserve level as stated in the Reserve Policy  the Mayor is to </br></br>propose a plan as part of the budget for the subsequent fiscal year to replenish such reserve in </br></br>a reasonable timeframe. As of the Fiscal Year 2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had total reserves </br>of $81.1 m</br>illion. As of January 31  </br>2010  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had total reserves of </br>$85.3 </br>million. </br> </br>The Rate Stabilization Fund is funded from operating revenues and serves as a source </br>of funds used to mitigate future rate increases. The Department expects the Rate Stabilization </br></br>Fund to be maintained at a level equal to 20% of Net System Revenues less operating and non </br></br>operating expenses or $21.3 m</br>illion. As of June 30  </br>2009  the balance was $19.3 m</br>illion  which </br>met the incremental target balance for Fiscal Year 2009. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund requested a $2 </br>million increase to the fund on January 20  </br>2010  to attain the targeted $21.3 m</br>illion by Fiscal </br>Year 2010. The use of amounts in the Rate Stab</br>ilization Fund does not require City Council </br>action. However  the Rate Stabilization Fund may only be used upon the recommendation of </br></br>the Department and approval of the Chief Financial Officer and must be used in a manner </br></br>consistent with the Installment Purchase Agreement. </br> </br>The Operating Reserve  which is a subset of cash on hand  is restricted for use in the </br>event an emergency situation resulting in a loss of revenue occurs and prevents the Wastewater </br></br>System from operating in its normal course of business. Amounts so used from the Operating </br></br>Reserve must be replenished no later than the subsequent fiscal year. The Operating Reserve is </br></br>calculated based on the annual operating budget for the fiscal year. The current Operating </br></br>Reserve for Fiscal Year 2010 is 50 days of the budget for Maintenance and Operations costs  </br></br>which is $33.7 m</br>illion. As of June 30  </br>2009  there was approximately $31.7 m</br>illion in the </br>Operating Reserve. As of January 31  2010  the Operating Reserve was $33.7 m</br>illion. The </br>Operating Reserve is expected to increase to 70 days of the budget for Maintenance and </br></br>Operation costs by Fiscal Year 2013  which is projected to be approximately $48.4 m</br>illion. </br> </br>The Department funded the Capital Improvement Reserve  which may only be used for </br>costs of the Wastewater System CIP  in the amount of $5.0 million for Fiscal Year </br>2009. City </br>Council action is required for any withdrawal from the Capital Improvement Reserve. As of </br></br>January 31  2010  approximately $5.0 mi</br>llion remained in the Capital Improvement Reserve. </br> </br>The Appropriated Reserve is budgeted annually for unanticipated expenditures. It may </br>be used to fund operating or capital requirements. If the Appropriated Reserve is used to fund </br></br>unanticipated operating expenses  the approval of the Director of the Public Works </br></br>Department is required and  if the Appropriated Reserve is to be used for unanticipated </br> 58  </br>capital needs  City Council action in the form of an ordinance is required. The Appropriated </br>Reserve was $3.4 million at the end of Fiscal Year </br>2009. As of January 31  2010  there was $3.5 </br>million in the Appropriated Reserve. </br> </br>In Fiscal Year 2008  the City established the DRES to save funds obtained by increasing </br>efficiencies  changing priorities or other actions related to reducing costs of the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP or operations and maintenance of the Wastewater System. The 2008 IROC Report </br></br>recommended that savings from the Sewer Utility Fund be transferred into the DRES in order </br></br>to improve accountability with respect to such savings and to provide funding of the </br></br>Wastewater System in future years in lieu of rate increases. The funds in the DRES may be </br></br>used for accelerating Wastewater System CIP project schedules and reducing the need for </br></br>future rate increases. At the end of each fiscal year  any savings not required for compliance </br></br>with established reserve policies will be transferred into the DRES. At the end of four years  </br></br>any funds transferred into the DRES and not used for capital improvements will be used to </br></br>lower future rates for the Wastewater System. As of June 30  2009  approximately $21.8 </br></br>million was on deposit in the DRES. As of January 31  </br>2010  $21.8 m</br>illion remained on deposit </br>in the DRES.  </br> </br>Table 15 below sets forth the amounts in the several reserves in the Sewer Revenue Fund </br>as of June 30  2009. </br> TABLE 15 </br>SEWER UTILITY FUND RESERVES </br> as of June 30  2009  </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Fund </br>Reserve Amount </br>Rate Stabilization Fund </br>$19 300 </br>Operating Reserve </br>31 653 </br>Capital Improvement Reserve </br>5 000 </br>Appropriated Reserve </br>3 394 </br>Dedicated Reserve for Efficiencies and Savings </br>21 792 </br>   Total </br>$81 139 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department and Comptroller’s Office  City of San Diego. </br>  59  </br>Historical Debt Service Coverage </br> Table 16 below sets forth the total revenues of the Wastewater System  the maintenance </br>and operation costs of the Wastewater System and the resulting debt service coverage for the </br></br>Outstanding Parity Obligations for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 16 </br>CALCULATION OF HISTORIC SENIOR AND AGGREGATE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE </br> $ In Thousands  </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009 </br> Unaudited  </br>   Total </br>Maintenance </br>and  </br> Senior Debt Service </br>All Obligations</br> 1 </br> Fiscal </br>Year </br>Ended </br>June 30 </br>System </br>Revenues </br>Operations </br>Costs of the </br>Wastewater </br>System </br>Net </br>System </br>Revenues </br>Principal </br>Interest </br>Total </br>Debt </br>Service </br>Coverage </br>Total </br>Debt </br>Service </br>Aggregate </br>Debt </br>Service </br>Coverage </br>2005 322 542 204 163 118 379 26 120 50 935 77 055 1.54 84 789 1.40 </br>2006 320 288 202 111 118 177 27 390 49 662 77 052 1.53 86 802 1.36 </br>2007 343 921 202 632 141 289 28 760 48 291 77 051 1.83 96 408 1.47 </br>2008 361 511 211 449 150 062 30 250 46 805 77 055 1.95 94 555 1.59 </br></br>2009 353 446 197 379 156 067 31 700 45 356 77 056 2.03 94 305 1.65 </br>    Source: Statistical section  unaudited  of the Fiscal Year 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.  </br></br> 1  All Obligations include Parity Obligations  Subordinated Obligations and the Existing SRF Loans. </br> Financial Projections </br> Table 17 below sets forth the financial forecast for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014. </br>Table 17 incorporates certain assumptions  including assumed inflation and interest rates  rate </br></br>increases and the amount of indebtedness to be issued during this period adopted by the </br></br>Department.

Revenues </br>consists of sewer service charges  sewer treatment plant services  services to others  sale of power from </br>cogeneration  contributions in aid  and other miscellaneous sources. Net Revenues assume a 4% annual rate </br>increase to Sewer Service Charges in 2012  2013 and 2014. Net Revenues in 2011 include a one time expected </br>payment from the City of El Cajon for its proportionate share of past capital improvement expenditures. This </br></br>revenue is classified as “Contributions In Aid.” Maintenance and Operation Costs are inflated at 4% each year  </br>excluding personnel expenses </br> 2  Excludes amounts in the Acquisition Fund. </br> 3  The amounts for each of the Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014 assume an approximate average annual 1% EDU </br>growth rate over each of the four fiscal years.

A sixth labor organization  the Deputy City Attorneys Association represents </br>unclassified deputy city attorneys.  </br> </br>As of January 26  2010  there were 827.5 regular full time wastewater employees of the </br>Department  of which 461 are represented by the Municipal Employees Association  “MEA”  </br></br>and 329 are represented by American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  </br></br>AFL CIO  Local 127  “AFSCME Local 127” . The remaining 37.5 employees are </br></br>unrepresented. The two bargaining units represent approximately 95% of the Department’s </br></br>employees. </br> </br>Contracts for Fiscal Year 2010 and 2011</br>. On April 14  2009  the City Council unanimously </br>approved the terms of the labor agreements for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 for the MEA  the </br></br>International Association of Firefighters Local 145  “IAFF Local 145”  and DCAA. </br></br>Negotiations with the remaining two bargaining units  AFSCME Local 127 and the Police </br></br>Officers Association  “POA”   did not end in agreement.

Pursuant to the labor agreements for the bargaining units and the </br></br>terms and conditions approved for AFSCME Local 127 and POA  all five bargaining units and </br></br>the City’s unclassified and unrepresented employees will be held to a general salary freeze and </br></br>subject to a 6% reduction in overall compensation which has been implemented through salary </br></br>reductions  decreases in the City paid allotment of the employee share for employee health </br></br>care  retirement and other employment benefits  fewer paid holidays and mandatory </br></br>furloughs. Each bargaining unit reached the 6% target through a different combination of these </br></br>measures. The compensation reductions also apply to management and unrepresented City </br></br>employees  including the Mayor  his staff  and some independent departments. Departments </br></br>not under Mayoral control including some City Council offices did not participate in some or </br></br>all of the compensation reductions. </br> </br>The City is currently engaged in contract negotiations for Fiscal Year 2011 with the </br>POA  AFSCME Local 127  and the California Teamsters Local 911. Negotiations are ongoing </br></br>with a target date for completion being April 15  2010. </br> </br>Pension Benefit Agreement</br>. On July 28  2008  the City Council ratified an agreement </br>regarding the creation of new pension benefits for non safety City employees with MEA  </br></br>AFSCME Local 127 and DCAA  the “New Pension Plan” . The City expects to save on its </br></br>pension costs over time as new hires are included under the New Pension Plan. The New </br></br>Pension Plan became effective on July 1  2009 and applies to non safety employees hired on or </br></br>after the effective date. The New Pension Plan lowers the defined benefit factor at age 55 and </br></br>60 from 2.50% to 1.00% and from 2.55% to 2.00%  respectively  and modifies the benefit </br></br>formula  which currently permits retirees to receive up to 90.00% of their highest one year </br></br>salary  by limiting compensation available under the pension plan to 80.00% of the highest </br></br>three years average of compensation. In addition  the New Pension Plan establishes a retiree </br></br>medical trust into which both the City and employees will equally contribute 0.25% of salary </br></br>and establishes a new defined contribution component in addition to the defined benefit </br></br>component. The New Pension Plan includes mandatory employee contributions of 1.00% of </br></br>salary  with a City match component. See Note 12 to the City’s Fiscal Year 2009 audited </br></br>financial statements attached hereto as APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  </br></br>REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND CERTAIN EXCERPTS FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009.” </br>  62  </br>Insurance and Liability Claims </br> The Department is self insured for workers’ compensation and long term disability and </br>for public liability claims exposure up to $5 million per occurrence. For liability between $5 </br></br>million and </br>$50 million  the Department is covered by the City  which purchases insurance in </br>collaboration with the California State Association of Counties—Excess Insurance Authority  a </br></br>statewide joint powers authority risk pool  in layers for its public liability exposure. </br> </br>The City participates in the joint purchase of property insurance and flood insurance </br>through the CSAC EIA pool which includes flood and earthquake coverage for scheduled </br></br>locations  including bond financed locations of the Wastewater System. This joint purchase of </br></br>the City’s “all risk” property insurance  insuring approximately $2.73 billion of City property  </br></br>provides coverage for loss to City property under the primary policy up to approximately $25 </br></br>million per occurrence  with a </br>$25 000 deductible. Depending on availab</br>ility and affordability </br>of earthquake insurance  the City may elect not to purchase such coverage in the future. The </br></br>City does not maintain any casualty insurance on the pipelines of the Wastewater System </br></br>because such insurance is not commercially available. </br> </br>Table 18 below sets forth the accrued estimated liabilities and expenditures for liability </br>claims of the Wastewater System for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 18 </br>LIABILITY CLAIMS BUDGETED AND EXPENDITURES </br>Fiscal Years 2005 to 2009 </br> Unaudited  </br> Fiscal Year </br>Budgeted Liabilities </br>Expenditures</br> 1 </br> 2005 $2 589 000 $1 814 378 </br>2006 2 589 000 500 928 </br></br>2007 2 589 000 1 052 219 </br>2008 1 283 412 1 612 392 </br>2009 1 283 412 884 769 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department and Risk Management Department  City of San Diego. </br></br> 1  Over budget expenditures are paid from Sewer Revenue Fund balance available for appropriation. </br> Investment of Funds </br> General</br>. Amounts in the funds and accounts of the Sewer Revenue Fund are invested by </br>the City Treasurer in the Treasurer’s Pooled Investment Fund  the “City Pool”  described </br></br>below and the City accounts for such amounts separately from other funds of the City. </br> </br>City Pool</br>. In accordance with the Charter of the City and authority granted by the City </br>Council  the City Treasurer is responsible for investing the unexpended cash in the City Pool. </br></br>Responsibility for the daily investment of funds in the City Pool is delegated to the City’s Chief </br></br>Investment Officer. The City and certain related entities are the only participants in the City </br></br>Pool; there are no other City Pool participants either voluntary or involuntary in the City Pool. </br></br>The investment objectives of the City Pool are preservation of capital  liquidity and return. </br> </br>Oversight and Reporting Requirements</br>. The City Treasurer provides an investment report </br>on a monthly basis to the Chief Financial Officer  the City Comptroller and the City Council </br></br>and annually presents the Investment Policy to the Chief Financial Officer  the Investment </br></br>Advisory Committee and the City Council. The Investment Advisory Committee is comprised </br></br>of two City employees  currently the Chief Financial Officer and the Director of Debt </br></br>Management  and three investment professionals from the private sector and is charged with </br> 63  </br>overseeing the review of the City’s Investment Policy and practices of the City Treasurer and </br>recommending changes thereto. Investments in the City Pool are audited annually by an </br></br>independent firm of certified public accountants as part of the overall audit of the City’s </br></br>financial statements. </br> </br>The City’s investments division uses outside services to provide investment portfolio </br>valuations and accounting and reporting services. These services provide monthly portfolio </br></br>valuation  investment performance statistics  and other portfolio reports that are distributed to </br></br>the Office of the City Treasurer accounting section and the Office of the Comptroller of the </br></br>City for review and reconciliation. The Office of the City Treasurer’s accounting section </br></br>prepares a series of monthly reports  including the portfolio market valuation  and distributes </br></br>these to the Mayor  City Council  Chief Financial Officer  and other officials. </br> </br>Authorized Investments</br>. Investments in the City Pool are governed by State law and </br>further restricted by the City’s Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is prepared with </br></br>safety of principal being the foremost objective. Permitted investments include U.S. Treasury </br></br>securities  U.S. Agency securities  U.S. Agency mortgage backed securities  corporate medium </br></br>term notes  money market instruments  non negotiable FDIC insured certificates of deposit </br></br>and the Local Agency Investment Fund  California State Pool . Reverse repurchase agreements </br></br> “reverse repos”  are restricted to 20% of the base value of the portfolio and are governed by </br></br>various maturity restrictions as well. The main operating funds of the City are managed in two </br></br>separate portfolios. In its management of the “Liquidity” portfolio  comprising about 35% of </br></br>total funds  the City invests in a variety of debt securities with maturities ranging from one </br></br>day to one year. The remaining 65% of funds are managed in a separate “Core” portfolio that </br></br>consists of a variety of debt securities ranging from one day to five years; performance is </br></br>measured against the Merrill Lynch one  to three year U.S. Treasury Index. The 35% </br></br>Liquidity 65% Core portfolio split serves as a guideline. The actual split may vary due to </br></br>market conditions or other factors. Safety of principal and liquidity are paramount </br></br>considerations in the management of both portfolios. </br> </br>Pool Liquidity and Other Characteristics</br>. The City Pool  including both the “Liquidity” </br>and the “Core” portfolios  is highly liquid. Based on preliminary and unaudited month end </br></br>data as of December 31  2009  approximately 13% of the pool investments mature within 62 </br></br>days  16% within 92 days and 22% within 184 days  34% within 1 year  72% within 2 years  </br></br>99% within 3 years  and 100% within 5 years  on a cumulative basis . As of December 31  </br></br>2009  the Pool had a weighted average maturity of 1.44 years  524 days  and its weighted </br></br>average yield was 1.143%. For purposes of calculating weighted average maturity  the City </br></br>Treasurer treats investments in the State wide Local Agency Investment Fund  California State </br></br>Pool  as maturing within one day. The Liquidity portfolio had a duration of 0.40 years and the </br></br>Core portfolio had a duration of 1.85 years as of December 31  2009. Duration is a measure of </br></br>the price volatility of the portfolio and reflects an estimate of the projected increase or decrease </br></br>in the value of the portfolio based upon a decrease or increase in interest rates. Accordingly  </br></br>the Liquidity portfolio should decrease in market value by 0.40% for every 1% increase in </br></br>market interest rates while the Core portfolio should decrease in market value by 1.85% for </br></br>every 1% increase in market interest rates. The City Pool’s composition is designed with a goal </br></br>of having sufficient liquid funds available to meet disbursement requirements. The </br></br>composition and value of investments under management in the City Pool will vary from time </br></br>to time depending on cash flow needs of the City  maturity or sale of investments  purchase of </br></br>new securities  and fluctuations in interest rates. </br>  64  </br>Table 19 below sets forth the City Pool results at December 31  2009. </br> TABLE 19 </br>CITY OF SAN DIEGO POOLED INVESTMENT FUND </br>at December 31  2009 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Investment Instrument </br>Book Value </br>Fair Value </br>Percent of Total</br> 1 </br> U.S. Treasury Bills and Notes </br>$    </br>926 952 </br>$    927 188 </br>44.96% </br>Federal Agency Securities</br> 2 </br> 753 964 754 388 36.57 </br>Medium Term Notes  Corporate </br> 3 </br> 194 391 195 636 9.43 </br>Money Market Instruments</br> 4 </br> 136 340 136 340 6.62 </br>Local Agency Investment Fund 49 891 </br>49 891 </br>2.42 </br>TOTAL INVESTMENTS </br>$2 061 538 </br>$2 063 443 </br>100.00% </br>    Source: Office of the City Treasurer  City of San Diego.  </br> 1  Based on book value. </br></br> 2  Federal National Mortgage Association  “Fannie Mae”  securities and Federal Home Loan Mortgage </br>Corporation  “Freddie Mac”  securities represent 20.24% and 27.25%  respectively  of total Federal Agency </br></br>Securities  which is approximately 7.40% and 9.97%  respectively  of the City Pool. </br> 3  These notes consist of both fixed and floating interest rate securities.

The challenges posed by the unfunded pension </br>liability are significant and  together with significant costs related to postemployment </br></br>healthcare benefits  pose a threat to the future fiscal health of the City. However  as explained </br></br>below under the caption  “Sewer Utility Fund Share of Contribution to Pension System and </br></br>NPO ” the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the City’s annual required contributions </br></br>to the Pension System is approximately 4.95%  equal to approximately $7.6 million  assuming </br></br>a City pension payment of $154.2 m</br>illion  for Fiscal Year </br>2010. Estimates of the Sewer Ut</br>ility </br>Fund’s share of the City’s annual contributions of approximately $14.4 m</br>illion for each of </br>Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 were included in the 2007 Rate Case model that served as the </br></br>basis for the annual rate increases in effect through Fiscal Year 2011 that were approved by the </br></br>City Council. For Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010  the actual contributions required from the Sewer </br></br>Utility Fund were less than the amounts that were assumed in the </br>2007 Rate Case model.  </br> </br>The City’s annual required contribution  “ARC”  payment for Fiscal Year 2011 w</br>ill be </br>$231.7 m</br>illion if paid on July 1  </br>2010. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s expected proportionate share </br>of the ARC payment is 7.08%  which would result in a contribution by the Sewer Utility Fund </br></br>of approximately $16.4 m</br>illion for Fiscal Year </br>2011. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s proportionate </br>share is increasing in Fiscal Year 2011 primarily due to a Department reorganization which </br></br>resulted in budgeted positions being moved from the Water Utility Fund to the Sewer Utility </br></br>Fund. These positions were previously fully captured as a non personnel expense in a service </br></br>level agreement between the two funds. This reorganization of positions will have no material </br></br>impact on the Fiscal Year 2011 operations and maintenance budget for the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund. </br> </br>The amounts and percentages set forth under this caption relating to the City’s Pension </br>System  including  for example  actuarial accrued liabilities and funded ratios  are based upon </br> 65  </br>numerous demographic and economic assumptions  including investment return rates  </br>inflation rates  salary increase rates  cost of living adjustments  postemployment mortality  </br></br>active member mortality  and rates of retirement. The prospective purchasers of the Series </br></br>2010A Bonds are cautioned to review and carefully assess the reasonableness of the </br></br>assumptions set forth in the documents that are cited as the sources for the information under </br></br>this caption. In addition  the prospective purchasers of the Series 2010A Bonds are cautioned </br></br>that such sources and the underlying assumptions speak as of their respective dates  and are </br></br>subject to change  any one of which could cause a significant change in the UAAL  as defined </br></br>below . </br> </br>SDCERS is considered part of the City’s financial reporting entity and is included in the </br>City’s CAFR as a pension system trust fund. SDCERS does prepare its own CAFR  the most </br></br>recent of which is for Fiscal Year 2009. </br> </br>UAAL and its Calculation</br>. According to the June 30  2009 Annual Actuarial Valuation of </br>SDCERS  prepared by Cheiron  Inc.  “Cheiron”  dated as of January 8  2010  the “2009 </br></br>Valuation”   the funded ratio  the actuarial value of assets available for benefits to total </br></br>actuarial accrued liability  of the City’s portion of the SDCERS fund</br>1 was 66.5%  and the </br>SDCERS fund had an unfunded actuarial accrued liability  the </br>“UAAL”  of $2.106 b</br>illion. </br>Thus  for every dollar of benefits due  all vested liabilities   SDCERS had $.66 in assets </br></br>available for payment as of June 30  2009. The UAAL is the difference between total </br></br>actuarially accrued liabilities  the </br>“AAL”  which was approximately $6.282 b</br>illion as of June </br>30  2009  and actuarially calculated assets allocated to funding  which was approximately </br></br>$4.175 b</br>illion as of June 30  </br>2009. </br> </br>Global financial markets experienced significant volatility in fiscal year </br>2009 and </br>SDCERS experienced an actuarial investment loss of $811.4 m</br>illion in the City’s plan during </br>that period. According to the City’s June 30  2008 Annual Actuarial Valuation  the “2008 </br></br>Valuation”  and the 2009 Valuation  the actuarial value of assets  City’s portion  as of June </br></br>30  2008 and June 30  2009 were respectively $4.660 b</br>illion and $4.</br>175 billion. The market </br>value of assets  City’s portion  as of June 30  2008 and June 30  2009  as reported in the 2008 </br></br>Valuation and the 2009 Valuation  respectively  were $4.409 b</br>illion and $3.</br>479 billion. A </br>decline in the actuarial value of assets over time will result in an increase to the City’s ARC in </br></br>comparison to the amounts estimated in the Five Year Financial Outlook for Fiscal Years 2010 </br></br>11 through 2014 15; however  the impact on the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund would be expected to be </br>minimal. See the text under the headings “—City Contributions to SDCERS” and “—Sewer </br></br>Utility Fund Share of Contributions to Pension System and NPO” below.  </br> </br>Actuarial Assumptions</br>. The following are the principal actuarial assumptions used by </br>SDCERS’ actuary in preparing the valuation as of June 30  2009: </br> </br>1. Investment Return Rate: 7.75% a year  net of administrative expenses  </br>compounded annually.  </br>2. Inflation Rate: 4.00% a year  compounded annually. </br>3. Interest Credited to Member Contributions: 7.75% compounded annually. </br>4. Salary Increase Rates: Comprised of a 4.00% inflation rate and 0.5% to 8.0% </br>merit component. </br>5. Annual Cost of Living Adjustments: 2.00% per year  compounded annually. </br>                                                       </br> 1 The City participates in SDCERS along with the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority  “Airport </br>Authority”  and the San Diego Unified Port District  “Port District” .  The information herein refers only to the </br>City’s participation in SDCERS and not to the participation of the Airport Authority or the Port District.   </br> 66  </br>6. Additional Assumptions: Additional assumptions were used regarding rates of </br>separation from active membership  post retirement mortality  active member </br>mortality and rates of retirement. </br> </br>“Smoothing” Methodology</br>. In determining the actuarial value of its assets  SDCERS  as </br>permitted by applicable actuarial guidelines  uses an expected value of assets “smoothing” </br></br>methodology to reduce the impact of market volatility on plan assets. The market value of </br></br>assets represents  as of the valuation date  the value of the assets as if they were liquidated on </br></br>that date. The actuarial value of assets is a value that attempts to smooth annual investment </br></br>return performance over multiple years to reduce annual contribution volatility. The actuarial </br></br>value of assets is used to determine SDCERS’ contribution rates for the City. As of June 30  </br></br>2009  the market value of plan assets was $3.479 b</br>illion  and the actuarial value was $4.</br>175 billion. By the smoothing method used in the </br>2009 Valuation  the calculation of the actuarial </br>value of assets at June 30  2009 started with the actuarial value of assets at June 30  2008  </br></br>added to that 100% of the actuarially assumed rate of return  plus the contribution towards </br></br>plan assets  less payments out from plan assets  plus 25% of the difference between the </br></br>expected actuarial value of assets at June 30  2009  using the above calculation  and the </br></br>actual market value of assets at June 30  2009. In no event w</br>ill the actuarial value of assets </br>ever be less than 80% of the market value of assets nor greater than 120% of the market value </br></br>of assets. The impact of this smoothing methodology will vary each year depending upon the </br></br>year’s actual market value compared to the expected value of assets  either as a net gain or a </br></br>net loss. The City expects SDCERS to employ the smoothing method used in the 2009 </br></br>Valuation to valuations for future fiscal years. As a result of the smoothing methodology  even </br></br>a healthy increase in the market value of the SDCERS’ plan assets as of June 30  2010 would </br></br>have a limited impact on improving the fiscal year 2012 ARC. For example  holding all other </br></br>actuarial assumptions constant  an annual investment return of 25% for fiscal year 2010 is </br></br>estimated to result in an ARC of $244.2 m</br>illion on a citywide basis for fiscal year </br>2012  compared to an ARC of $231.7 m</br>illion for fiscal year </br>2011 . This is primarily due to the fact </br>that  because of the smoothing methodology  approximately 45% of fiscal year 2009’s market </br></br>loss has yet to be captured in future ARC calculations and only 25% of any fiscal year </br>2010 gains will be included in the fiscal year </br>2012 ARC calculation. </br> </br>City Contributions to SDCERS</br>. The City’s ARC consists of:  i  the “normal cost ” being </br>the present value of the benefits that SDCERS expects to become payable in the future </br></br>attributable to a current year’s employment  and  ii  payments made to amortize the UAAL. </br></br>SDCERS currently amortizes the UAAL over several different closed periods: the amortization </br></br>of changes in the UAAL due to assumption changes is over 30 years  the amortization of </br></br>changes in the UAAL due to benefit changes is over five years  the outstanding balance of the </br></br>Fiscal Year 2007 UAAL is amortized over 20 years  such that  as of Fiscal Year 2009  18 years </br></br>of amortization remain   and subsequent yearly gains and losses are amortized over 15 years.  </br></br>Finally  if necessary  there is an additional UAAL cost component to ensure that there is no </br></br>negative amortization in any year  all as approved by the SDCERS Board of Administration in </br></br>its administrative capacity pursuant to its plenary authority over the Pension System. See </br></br>Note 12 to the City’s audited financial statements attached hereto in Appendix A for a </br></br>description of the shorter amortization period prescribed by the City Charter. For several years  </br></br>the City was paying less than the full ARC. The reasons for this are numerous  including prior </br></br>agreements between the City and SDCERS  earnings on pension assets at greater than the </br></br>previous actuarially assumed rate of 8% being credited against contributions  payments </br></br>pursuant to litigation settlements that were mistakenly characterized as “contingent” and </br></br>therefore not made in certain years  and other reasons explained in detail in Note 12 to the </br></br>City’s 2009 audited financial statements. See APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL </br></br>STATEMENTS AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>FISCAL YEAR 2009” attached hereto. </br> 67  </br> Due to the City’s prior practice of funding the Pension System at less than actuarially </br>required levels  the City has a Net Pension Obligation  “NPO”   which is the cumulative </br></br>difference between the annual pension cost  “Annual Pension Cost”  to the City of the Pension </br></br>System and the actual contribution in a particular year. The Annual Pension Cost is equal to </br></br> i  the ARC   ii  one year’s interest on the NPO  and  iii  an adjustment to the ARC to offset  </br></br>approximately  the amount included in item  i  for amortization of the past contribution </br></br>deficiencies. </br> </br>In Fiscal Year 2009  the City’s total pension payment  including its pension ARC and its </br>contribution for the Preservation of Benefits Plan referenced in the CAFR for Fiscal Year 2009 </br></br> the “Preservation of Benefits Plan”   was $163.6 m</br>illion. The City’s NPO at the end of Fiscal </br>Year 2009 was $177.8 m</br>illion. The City’s pension payment for Fiscal Year </br>2010 is $154.2 </br>million and has been paid in full. The City anticipates contributing an additional $1.4 million </br></br>for the Preservation of Benefits Plan for Fiscal Year 2010. </br> </br>Table 20 below sets forth the City’s portion of SDCERS historical funding progress for </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 20 </br>CITY OF SAN DIEGO </br>Schedule of Funding Progress </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Valuation Date </br> June 30  </br>Valuation Assets </br>AAL </br>Funded Ratio </br>UAAL 1 </br> 2005 1   2 </br> $2 983 080 $4 436 017 67.25% $1 452 937 </br>2006 1 </br> 3 981 932 4 982 700 79.92 1 000 768 </br>2007 3 </br> 4 413 411 5 597 653 78.84 1 184 242 </br>2008 4 660 346 5 963 550 78.15 1 303 204 </br>2009 4 175 229 6 281 593 66.47 2 106 364 </br>    Source: City of San Diego Comprehensive Annual Financial Report with respect to data for Fiscal Years 2005 </br>through 2008. 2009 Valuation for Fiscal Year 2009. </br> 1  Projected Unit Cost method used for determining actuarial accrued liability. </br> 2  For Fiscal Year 2005  the actuarial accrued liab</br>ility  the </br>UAAL and the funded ratio have been adjusted to </br>reflect the impact of the Corbett contingent settlement benefit.

However  the valuations </br></br>prepared by the actuary for Fiscal Years 2006 through Fiscal Year 2009 do include the impact of the Corbett </br>contingent settlement benefit. See Note 12 to the CAFR for Fiscal Year 2009 attached hereto as APPENDIX A. </br> 3  Reflects revised actuarial methodologies.

Prior to Fiscal Year 2007  the Projected Unit Cost method was </br></br>used. </br> Sewer Utility Fund Share of Contribution to Pension System and NPO</br>. For Fiscal Year 2009  </br>the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share to fully fund the City’s contribution to the </br></br>pension system was $7.6 million  and for Fiscal Year </br>2010 such share is $7.6 m</br>illion. The Sewer </br>Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case projection  which was the basis for the sewage service charge </br>increases set forth in Table 9 and approved by the City Council  see “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Establishment  Calculation and Collection of Sewer Service </br></br>Charge Revenue and Treatment Plant Services Revenue” and “—Calculation and Collection of </br></br>Capacity Charges”   included $14.4 m</br>illion as the Sewer Utility Fund’s estimated annual </br>proportionate share of the City’s ARC for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011. The City expects </br></br>that the $57.6 m</br>illion total estimate included in the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case </br>projection for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 w</br>ill be sufficient to pay the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br> 68  </br>proportionate share to fully fund the City’s contribution to the Pension System for such years. </br>The Sewer Utility Fund’s share of the NPO at June 30  2009  is approximately $10.8 m</br>illion. </br>See the City’s Fiscal Year 2009 audited financial statements attached hereto  line item entitled </br></br>“Non Current Liabilities Net Pension Obligation” under the table entitled “Proprietary Funds </br></br>Statement of Net Assets.” </br> </br>The following Table 21 sets forth  for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011  the City’s total </br>pension contributions  including its core pension contribution and the Preservation of Benefits </br></br> POB  Plan contribution   the pension contributions included in the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case projection and the corresponding actual  budgeted or projected contributions  which </br></br>have been lower than the 2007 rate case projections in total for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 </br></br> 2007 rate case projections are from 2008 through 2011 . </br> TABLE 21 </br>CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND SEWER UTILITY FUND </br>PENSION CONTRIBUTION </br>Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 </br> $ In Millions  </br>Fiscal Year  </br>ending June 30 </br>  ARC 1 </br> Total City  </br>Pension Contribution</br> 2 </br> Department Rate  </br>Case Projection</br> 3 </br> Actual  </br>Budgeted Projected</br> 2 </br> 2008 $140.1 $166.6</br> 4 </br> $14.4 $10.2</br> 5 </br> 2009 165.7 163.6</br> 4 </br> 14.4 7.6</br> 5 </br> 2010 155.2 155.6</br>  4 </br> 14.4 </br> 7.6</br> 6 </br> 2011 231.7</br> 7 </br> 233.2</br>  4 </br> 14.4 16.4</br>  6 </br>     Source: The City of San Diego Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year ended June 30  2008 and </br>June 30  2009; City of San Diego Financial Management Department and the Public Ut</br>ilities Department. </br> 1 </br> Includes core pension ARC and POB Plan ARC. Per IRS guidelines  the City may not pre fund the POB Plan. </br></br>Therefore  plan contributions may differ from the ARC in any given year. See footnote 4. </br> 2 </br> FY 2008 and 2009: Audited; FY 2010: Budgeted; and FY 2011: Projection. </br> 3 </br> Reflects projections as of the date of the 2007 Rate Case. </br> 4 </br> FY 2008: Includes $137.7 mi</br>llion core pension contribution per SDCERS June 30  </br>2006 Actuarial Valuation  $1 </br>million POB Plan contribution  and </br>$27.9 m</br>illion in additional voluntary contributions. FY </br>2009: Includes </br>$161.7 m</br>illion core pension contribution per SDCERS June 30  </br>2007 Actuarial Valuation  $1.2 m</br>illion POB Plan </br>contribution  and $700 000 in additional voluntary contributions. FY 2010: Includes $154.2 m</br>illion core pension </br>contribution per SDCERS June 30  2008 Actuarial Valuation and a budgeted $1.4 m</br>illion POB Plan contribution. </br>FY 2011: Includes the core pension contribution per SDCERS June 30  2009 Actuarial Valuation and a projected </br></br>$1.5 million POB Plan contribution. </br> 5 </br> Actual. The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share to fully fund the City’s pension contribution  excluding </br>contributions for the POB Plan   was 6.16% for Fiscal Year 2008 and 4.68% for Fiscal Year 2009. The Department </br>contributes to the POB Plan only if its employees receive benefits thereunder. The Department was not required to </br></br>contribute to the POB Plan in Fiscal Year 2008 or 2009. The Department’s contribution to the POB  if any  for </br>subsequent Fiscal Years will be determined at the end of the respective fiscal years. See footnote  6  below for a </br>discussion of adjustments to the proportionate share. </br> 6 </br> Fiscal Year 2010 budgeted amount and Fiscal Year 2011 projected amount  assuming the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s </br>proportionate share to fully fund the City’s pension contribution  excluding contributions for the POB Plan   is </br></br>4.95% and 7.08%  respectively. The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share is established at the beginning of a </br></br>Fiscal Year and may increase or decrease during the year and from year to year depending on a variety of </br>factors  including the number of covered employees attributable to the Sewer Utility Fund  the retirement benefits </br>accruing to such employees and end of the year payroll adjustments.   </br> 7 </br> The POB Plan ARC has not yet been determined for FY 2011 and  accordingly  has not been included. </br> Actual and budgeted amounts set forth above reflect amounts necessary for the City to </br>satisfy its pension contribution requirement for each fiscal year and may be more or less than </br></br>the amounts projected in the 2007 Rate Case. To date  amounts included in the Sewer Ut</br>ility </br>Fund’s 2007 Rate Case for Fiscal Years 2008 2011 have in total exceeded the amounts actually </br></br>required to satisfy the Sewer Utility Fund’s pension contribution requirement.  </br>  69  </br>In addition to the City’s ARC payment  the City has entered into a court approved </br>class action settlement in the case of </br>William J. McGuigan v. City of San Diego  et. al.</br>  that </br>requires the City to make a payment of the remaining settlement amount of approximately </br>$32.8 m</br>illion plus any interest accrued under the settlement to SDCERS by June 8  </br>2011. Due </br>to the unreasonable hardship that would result if the City were required to make this payment </br></br>within the proscribed time period  the City will seek to modify the settlement agreement to </br></br>allow the City to pay the remaining settlement amount over four years. The modified </br></br>settlement  if approved by the Court  would not significantly affect the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br></br>payment of its proportionate share of the McGuigan settlement. If the modified settlement is </br></br>approved  the Sewer Utility Fund’s payment would be approximately $2.3 million if made on </br></br>the expected payment date of June 30  2010. If the settlement is not modified  the Sewer </br></br>Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the payment would be would be approximately $2.4 </br></br>million if paid on June 8  </br>2011. This lawsuit involved the underfunding of the pension system </br></br>by the City and all payments made under the settlement are credited against the UAAL. </br> Postemployment Healthcare Benefits </br></br> The City provides retiree healthcare benefits  also known as other postemployment </br>benefits  “OPEB”   to certain health eligible retired employees through a plan administered by </br></br>SDCERS. The City’s OPEB plan includes approximately 5 400 retirees  8 900 active employees </br></br>and 600 terminated vested members as of June 30  2009. Historically  OPEB expenses were </br></br>funded on a pay as you go basis. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2008  the City entered into an </br></br>agreement with the California Public Employees Retirement System  “CalPERS”  as a </br></br>participating employer in the CalPERS Employers Retirement Benefits Trust  “CERBT”  to </br></br>pre fund future OPEB expenses. In fiscal year 2009  the City contributed approximately $25.6 </br></br>million to SDCERS to pay current OPEB expenses and contributed an additional amount of </br></br>approximately $23.9 m</br>illion to the CERBT. In fiscal year </br>2010  the City budgeted </br>approximately $32.1 m</br>illion to SDCERS to pay current OPEB expenses and budgeted an </br>additional contribution of approximately $25 m</br>illion to the CERBT. As of December 31  </br>2009  </br>the balance in the CERBT was approximately $50.3 m</br>illion. </br> </br>The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the City’s pay as you go contribution </br>for OPEB was approximately $2.0 million for Fiscal Year </br>2009. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s </br>proportionate share of the contribution to CERBT was approximately $1.9 million. For Fiscal </br></br>Year 2010  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately $2.5 million and $2 </br>million  respectively  as its proportionate share of the City’s pay as you go OPEB contribution </br></br>and the CERBT contribution. </br> </br>As of the date of this Official Statement  the City has not fully funded its ARC for </br>OPEB  i.e.  the sum of the normal cost of the postemployment benefits plus amortization of </br></br>the OPEB UAAL . The City has not projected the amounts necessary to fully fund its OPEB </br></br>ARC payments beyond the amounts set forth in its October 2009 Five Year Financial Outlook </br></br>and does not expect to fully fund its OPEB ARC payment in that timeframe  as outlined in the </br></br>October 2009 Five Year Financial Outlook. All future contributions for postemployment </br></br>healthcare benefits will be credited toward the City’s ARC for retiree healthcare liabilities in </br></br>accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board  “GASB”  Statement No. 43  </br></br>“Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans”  “GASB </br></br>43”   and GASB Statement No. 45  “Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for </br></br>Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions”  “GASB 45” . See Note 13 to the Fiscal Year </br></br>2009 audited financial statements attached hereto in Appendix A. </br> </br>In connection with compliance with GASB 43 and GASB 45  the City has calculated its </br>net OPEB obligation  “NOPEBO”  as of June 30  2009 to be approximately $93.9 m</br>illion. The </br>NOPEBO is the cumulative difference between the City’s annual OPEB cost and City’s </br> 70  </br>contributions to OPEB in a particular year  including the OPEB liability or asset at transition  if </br>any. Annual OPEB cost is equal to  i  the ARC for OPEB   b  one year’s interest on the </br></br>NOPEBO from prior years  which the City determined to be zero at the beginning of Fiscal </br></br>Year 2008  the transition year  in accordance with GASB 45   and  c  an adjustment to the ARC </br></br>for OPEB to offset the effect of actuarial amortization of past under  or over contributions. </br></br>The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the City’s NOPEBO as of June 30  </br>2009 was </br>$6.9 million. The City intends to pre fund the CERBT with approximately </br>$25 million on an </br>annual basis  as described in Note 13 to the Fiscal Year 2009 audited financial statements </br></br>attached hereto in Appendix A. </br> </br>An actuarial valuation of the City’s postemployment medical benefit program as of </br>June 30  2009  the “2009 OPEB Valuation”  was performed by Buck Consultants for the </br></br>purpose of determining the City’s annual cost in accordance with GASB 45. The valuation  </br></br>dated September 17  2009  reflected a discount rate of 6.69% based on the City’s actual and </br></br>expected contributions to CERBT  inflation factors for increases in healthcare costs and </br></br>premium costs  and a 30 year amortization period  open basis . According to the 2009 OPEB </br></br>Valuation  using the assumptions described above and consistent with GASB 45  the UAAL </br></br>for OPEB for all retirees  deferred retirement participants  vested terminated and active </br></br>members was $1.32 billion and the ARC for OPEB will be </br>$120.32 m</br>illion for Fiscal Year 2011 </br> as reported in the actuarial valuation dated June 30  2009 . </br> </br>Table 22 below sets forth the retiree health contributions included in the Sewer Utility </br>Fund’s 2007 Rate Case projection for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 and the corresponding </br></br>actual  budgeted or projected amounts  which have been lower than the projected amounts set </br></br>forth in the 2007 Rate Case. Amounts budgeted for future years may be lower than amounts </br></br>set forth in the 2007 Rate Case projection. The City expects that such amount w</br>ill be sufficient </br>to pay the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share to fund the City’s contribution to OPEB </br></br>for such years. Projections sets forth in the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case include </br>amounts through Fiscal Year 2011  years through which sewer rates were approved by the City </br></br>Council.  </br>  71  </br>TABLE 22 </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br>RETIREE HEALTH CONTRIBUTION </br>Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 </br> $ In Millions  </br> Fiscal Year  </br>ending June 30 </br> ARC </br>Total City </br>Contribution </br>Rate  </br>Case Projection </br>Actual  </br>Budgeted Projected</br> 1 </br> 2008 $ 91.6 $53.6 $4.4 $4.2</br> 2 </br> 2009 104.5 49.5 6.7 3.9</br> 2 </br> 2010 113.4 57.1 9.1 4.5</br> 3  </br> 2011 120.3 62.2 9.1 5.5</br> 4  </br>     Source: The City of San Diego Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year ended June 30  2008 and </br>June 30  2009; City of San Diego Financial Management Department and the Public Ut</br>ilities Department. </br> 1  Consists of the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of pay as you go postemployment healthcare benefits </br>and its proportionate share of contributions to CalPERS for OPEB. The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate </br>share of OPEB for Fiscal Year 2008 was 7.84% and for Fiscal Year 2009 was 7.88%. Proposed and projected </br></br>amounts reflect an assumed Sewer Utility Fund proportionate share of 7.96% for Fiscal Year </br>2010 and 8.8% for </br>Fiscal Year 2011. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s proportionate share may increase or decrease from year to year </br>depending on a variety of factors  including the number of covered employees attributable to the Sewer Utility </br>Fund and the retirement benefits accruing to such employees. </br> 2  Actual. </br></br> 3  Proposed Budget. </br></br> 4  Projected Department contribution based on the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share  see footnote  1  </br>above  of the City’s aggregate pay as you go postemployment healthcare contributions and OPEB contributions </br></br>through CalPERS  as set forth in the June 30  2009 Annual Actuarial Valuation.  </br>  RISK FACTORS </br> </br>The ability of the City to pay principal of and interest on the Series </br>2010A Bonds </br>depends primarily upon the receipt by the City of Net System Revenues. Some of the events </br></br>which could prevent the City from receiving a sufficient amount of Net System Revenues to </br></br>enable it to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2010A Bonds are summarized below. </br></br>The following description of risks is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the risks associated </br></br>with the purchase of the Series 2010A Bonds and the order of the risks set forth below does not </br></br>necessarily reflect the relative importance of the various risks. </br> Limited Obligations </br> </br>The obligation of the City to pay the 2010A Installment Payments securing the Series </br>2010A Bonds is a limited obligation of the City and is not secured by a legal or equitable </br></br>pledge or charge or lien upon any property of the City or any of its income or receipts  except </br></br>the Net System Revenues. The obligation of the City to make the 2010A Installment Payments </br></br>does not constitute an obligation of the City to levy or pledge any form of taxation or for which </br></br>the City has levied or pledged any form of taxation. The City is obligated under the </br></br>Installment Purchase Agreement to make the Installment Payments solely from Net System </br></br>Revenues. </br> </br>No assurance can be made that Net System Revenues  estimated or otherwise  will be </br>realized by the City in amounts sufficient to pay the 2010A Installment Payments. Among </br></br>other matters  drought  general and local economic conditions and changes in law and </br></br>government regulations  including initiatives and moratoriums on growth  could adversely </br></br>affect the amount of Net System Revenues realized by the City. In addition  the realization of </br></br>future Net System Revenues is subject to  among other things  the capabilities of management </br></br>of the City  the ability of the City to provide sewer service to its retail customers and the </br> 72  </br>Participating Agencies  the ability of the City to establish  maintain and collect charges for the </br>Wastewater Service to its retail customers and the Participating Agencies and the ability of the </br></br>City to establish  maintain and collect rates and charges sufficient to pay for Operation and </br></br>Maintenance costs and the 2010A Installment Payments. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Historical Revenues and Expenses.” </br> Wastewater System Expenses and Collections </br></br> The Operation and Maintenance costs of the Wastewater System are expected to </br>increase in the next five years. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—</br></br>Financial Projections.” However  there can be no assurance that the City’s projected future </br></br>Maintenance and Operation costs for the Wastewater System will actually be as projected by </br></br>the Department and described in this Official Statement. In addition  demands on the </br></br>Wastewater System will increase due to population growth and regulatory requirements in the </br></br>future. Further  although the City has covenanted to prescribe  revise and collect rates and </br></br>charges for Wastewater Service in amounts necessary to pay the 2010A Installment Payments  </br></br>there can be no assurance that such amounts will be collected in the amounts and at the times </br></br>necessary to pay the 2010A Installment Payments sufficient to provide for the payment of the </br></br>Series 2010A Bonds. </br> Rate Setting Process Under Proposition 218 </br> </br>Proposition 218  which added Articles X</br>IIIC and XIIID to the California Consti</br>tution  </br>affects the City’s ability to impose f</br>uture rate increases  and no assurance can be given that </br>future rate increases will not encounter majority protest opposition or be challenged by </br></br>initiative action authorized under Proposition 218. During the last two Proposition 218 rate </br></br>increase hearings with respect to the Wastewater System  the Office of the City Clerk received </br></br>approximately 6% of the aggregate protests required to prevent the increase. In the event that </br></br>future proposed rate increases cannot be imposed as a result of majority protest or initiative  </br></br>the City might thereafter be unable to generate Net System Revenues in the amounts required </br></br>by the Installment Purchase Agreement to pay 2010A Installment Payments. Proposition 218 </br></br>also affects the Participating Agencies’ ability to collect sewer service charges and impose </br></br>future rate increases in amounts sufficient to make payments under the Regional Wastewater </br></br>Disposal Agreement and the Transportation Agreements. There can be no assurance that the </br></br>Participating Agencies have complied or will comply with the provisions of Proposition </br>218 or </br>that the Participating Agencies’ ability to impose future rate increases will not be adversely </br></br>affected by majority protests or initiatives. The Participating Agencies are required to pay the </br></br>amounts due under the Regional Wastewater Disposal Agreement regardless of the source of </br></br>payment. However  if the Participating Agencies are unable to pay amounts due and payable </br></br>for any reason  the City’s ability to generate Net System Revenues in the amounts required by </br></br>the Installment Purchase Agreement to pay 2010A Installment Payments could be adversely </br></br>affected. See “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND WASTEWATER RATES </br></br>AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID.” </br> </br>Notwithstanding the foregoing  the City has covenanted to fix  prescribe and collect </br>rates and charges for Wastewater Service at a level at least sufficient to meet its debt </br></br>requirements  as set forth under “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE </br></br>SERIES 2010A BONDS—Rate Covenant.” The current sewer rates for customers within the </br></br>City have been approved by the Mayor and the City Council and have been imposed in </br></br>compliance with Proposition 218. See “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND </br></br>WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID.”  </br>  73  </br>Statutory and Regulatory Compliance </br> Claims against the Wastewater System for failure to comply with applicable laws and </br>regulations could be significant. Such claims are payable from assets of the Wastewater </br></br>System or from other legally available sources. In addition to claims by private parties  </br></br>changes in the scope and standards for public agency Wastewater Systems such as that </br></br>operated by the Department may also lead to administrative orders issued by Federal or State </br></br>regulators. Future compliance with such orders can also impose substantial additional costs </br></br>on the Sewer Revenue Fund. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS.” No assurance can be given that the cost of compliance with such laws  </br></br>regulations and orders would not adversely affect the ability of the Wastewater System to </br></br>generate Net System Revenues sufficient to pay the 2010A Installment Payments. See </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Collection of Sewage ” “– </br></br>Treatment of Sewage” and “—Discharge and Disposal of Sewage.” However  the City has </br></br>covenanted in the Installment Purchase Agreement to fix  prescribe and collect rates and </br></br>charges for the Wastewater System which will yield Net System Revenues for each fiscal year </br></br>sufficient to pay debt service on the Parity Obligations  including the 2010A Installment </br></br>Payments securing the Series 2010A Bonds. All proposed increases for such rates and charges </br></br>for the Wastewater System are subject to the restrictions and requirements of Articles XIIIC </br></br>and XIIID of the California Consti</br>tution. </br> Earthquakes  Wildfires and Other Natural Disasters </br> </br>Although the City has not experienced any significant damage from seismic activities  </br>the geographic area in which the City is located is subject to unpredictable seismic activity. </br></br>Southern California is characterized by a number of geotechnical conditions which represent </br></br>potential safety hazards  including expansive soils and areas of potential liquefaction and </br></br>landslide. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could interrupt operation of the Wastewater </br></br>System and thereby interrupt the ability of the City to realize Net System Revenues sufficient </br></br>to pay the 2010A Installment Payments securing the payment of the Series 2010A Bonds. The </br></br>San Andreas  Rose Canyon  Elsinore and San Jacinto fault zones are all capable of producing </br></br>earthquakes in the San Diego area. In anticipation of such potential disasters  the City designs </br></br>and constructs all facilities of the Wastewater System to the seismic codes in effect at the time </br></br>of design of the project. The Wastewater System has not experienced any significant losses of </br></br>facilities or services as a result of earthquakes. Facilities within the Wastewater System </br></br>generally consist of pipelines and connections  flow control facilities  and pumping stations  </br></br>which are not typically vulnerable to damage by wildfires. All treatment facilities  pumping </br></br>stations and piping structures are designed in accordance with appropriate seismic design </br></br>requirements.  </br> </br>The above ground facilities within the Wastewater System are designed to be tolerant to </br>damage by wildfires through the use of fire resistant material where possible  such as concrete </br></br>and masonry blocks. In addition  the Department works closely with the City’s fire department </br></br>to ensure that proper vegetative clearances are maintained in and around the properties and </br></br>facilities of the Wastewater System. The Department watches for wildfires that may threaten </br></br>the facilities of the Wastewater System and operations and maintenance crews are dispatched </br></br>to ensure that all above ground facilities remain safe and operational. Further  during fires  the </br></br>Department works closely with the City’s fire department and law enforcement officers to </br></br>monitor and protect facilities of the Wastewater System to ensure continuous operation. One </br></br>pump station sustained minor damage from the October 2007 wildfires in San Diego County. </br> </br>Although the City has implemented disaster preparedness plans and made </br>improvements to Wastewater System facilities in connection with such natural disasters  there </br></br>can be no assurance that these or any additional measures will be adequate in the event that a </br> 74  </br>natural disaster occurs  nor that costs of preparedness measures will be as currently </br>anticipated. Further  damage to components of the Wastewater System could cause a material </br></br>increase in costs for repairs or a corresponding material adverse impact on Net System </br></br>Revenues. The City is not obligated under the Installment Purchase Agreement to procure and </br></br>maintain  or cause to be procured and maintained  nor does the City plan to procure and </br></br>maintain  earthquake insurance on the Wastewater System. </br> Risks Relating to the Water Supply </br> </br>The ability of the Wastewater System to operate effectively can be affected by the water </br>supply available to the City  which is situated in an arid and semi desert environment that is </br></br>currently subject to drought conditions. If the water supply decreases significantly  whether by </br></br>operation of mandatory supply restrictions  prohibitively high water costs or otherwise  flow </br></br>within the Wastewater System will diminish and Net System Revenues available to pay the </br></br>2010A Installment Payments may be adversely affected. Under current estimates  Wastewater </br></br>System operations and Net System Revenues are not expected to be materially adversely </br></br>affected if the Department is ordered to conserve up to 20% of its annual water supply  </br></br>receives an unexpectedly low water allocation  or becomes subject to penalties or additional </br></br>expenses because of an inability to meet the conservation goal. Further  the Department </br></br>anticipates that any such reduction in Net System Revenues would be offset in part by </br></br>reductions in the amount of sewage collected and treated by the Department  which would </br></br>reduce operational expenses. </br> Security of the Wastewater System </br> </br>The safety of the Wastewater System within the operational areas of the Department is </br>maintained via a combination of regular inspections by the Department employees  electronic </br></br>monitoring  and analysis of unusual incident reports. All above ground facilities  operated and </br></br>maintained by WWTD  including the Point Loma Plant  the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  the </br></br>North City Plant and South Bay Plant and pumping stations within the Wastewater System  </br></br>are controlled access facilities with fencing  gates  closed circuit television systems and security </br></br>officers at appropriate points. Smaller  above ground and subterranean pumping stations  </br></br>operated and maintained by WWC  are locked with padlock or internal locking mechanisms </br></br>and most are monitored via access intrusion alarms. Security improvements are evaluated on </br></br>an ongoing basis. The electronic operations and controls have been evaluated and exposure </br></br>reduced through a series of technology systems enhancements and integration. </br> </br>Military conflicts and terrorist activities may adversely impact the operations and </br>finances of the Wastewater System. The Department continually plans and prepares for </br></br>emergency situations and immediately responds to ensure sewer services are maintained. </br></br>However  there can be no assurance that any existing or additional safety and security </br></br>measures will prove adequate in the event that terrorist activities are directed against the </br></br>Wastewater System or that costs of security measures will not be greater than presently </br></br>anticipated. Further  damage to certain components of the Wastewater System could require </br></br>the City to increase expenditures for repairs to the Wastewater System significantly enough to </br></br>adversely impact the City’s ability to pay debt service on the Series </br>2010A. The City has </br>established within the Sewer Revenue the Operating Reserve  which is currently funded at a </br></br>minimum of 50 days’ operating costs  to be gradually increased to 70 days of operating costs </br></br>in Fiscal Years 2010 to Fiscal Year 2013 which may be used under certain circumstances for </br></br>repairs to the Wastewater System. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL </br></br>OPERATIONS—Rate Stabilization Fund and Other Funds and Accounts.” </br>  75  </br>Utility Costs </br> No assurance can be given that any future significant reduction or loss of power would </br>not materially adversely affect the operations of the Wastewater System. The volume of </br></br>wastewater conveyed and treated in the Wastewater System on a daily basis requires a </br></br>significant amount of electrical and thermal power. Electricity is needed to run several assets </br></br>including  among other things  pumps  lights  computers  mechanical valves and machinery. </br></br>Thermal energy  usually generated by electrical power or by burning natural gas  provides heat </br></br>and cooling necessary for both buildings and the wastewater treatment process. Energy in </br></br>excess of the amount necessary to power the Metropolitan Biosolids Center reduces the </br></br>amount of energy purchased by the Department from the local power grid for use at facilities </br></br>in the Wastewater System. The Department cannot guarantee that prices for electricity or gas </br></br>will not increase  which could adversely affect the Wastewater System’s financial condition. </br></br>Such increases in sewer rates and such other charges as well as increases in electricity and gas </br></br>costs are eligible to be “passed through” to the City’s sewer customers as increased sewer rates </br></br>in accordance with the City Municipal Code. Such “pass through” rate increases are subject to </br></br>Proposition 218 notice requirements. See “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES </br></br>AND WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID.” </br> </br>The Department operates an energy efficiency program at its facilities as a component </br>of its ongoing commitment to protect the environment by preserving our natural resources  </br></br>reducing power consumption  using renewable energy sources  seeking cheaper sources of </br></br>power and serving the needs of all our customers. Energy savings  if any  directly benefit the </br></br>residents of the City by helping to maintain lower sewer rates while providing renewable </br></br>electric energy to the region. </br> Impact of Current Fiscal Crisis on Wastewater System Revenues </br> </br>Since 2008  the United States financial markets have been experiencing extreme </br>volatility precipitated by major economic disruptions  including a severe economic recession </br></br>and significant credit and liquidity problems. The City cannot predict the extent to which the </br></br>fiscal problems will continue to be encountered in this and in any future Fiscal Years  and  it is </br></br>not clear what additional measures  if any  will be taken by the State or Federal government to </br></br>address the continuing fiscal crisis. Accordingly  the City cannot predict the final outcome of </br></br>future State or Federal actions or the impact that such actions will have on the Wastewater </br></br>System’s finances and operations. </br> </br>Pursuant to the Installment Purchase Agreement  the City is obligated to fix  prescribe </br>and collect rates and charges for Wastewater Service that will be at least sufficient to pay </br></br>during each Fiscal Year all Obligations  other than Parity Obligations  payable in such Fiscal </br></br>Year  and to yield during each Fiscal Year Net System Revenues equal to 120% of Debt Service </br></br> defined generally to mean the aggregate amount of principal  sinking fund payments and </br></br>interest payable in respect of all Parity Obligations for such Fiscal Year . The Installment </br></br>Purchase Agreement also prohibits the City from reducing the rates and charges then in effect </br></br>unless the Net System Revenues from such reduced rates and charges will at all times be </br></br>sufficient to meet the requirements of the Installment Purchase Agreement. Further  the </br></br>Indenture provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default  as </br></br>defined in the Indenture   including nonpayment of principal of or interest on the Series 2010A </br></br>Bonds  the holders of the Series 2010A Bonds may proceed to enforce their beneficial rights by </br></br>mandamus  or other suit  action or proceeding at law or in equity  which includes an action for </br></br>specific performance by the City with respect to its rate covenant and any other agreement </br></br>contained in the Installment Purchase Agreement. See also “RISK FACTORS—Rate Setting </br></br>Process Under Proposition 218” and “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND </br> 76  </br>WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID” for a description of </br>limitations on the rate setting process under the California Constitution. </br> </br>The Department has taken the current fiscal crisis into consideration in its projections of </br>capacity charges for the current and subsequent fiscal years. In Fiscal Year 2009  $10.4 m</br>illion </br>was generated which includes a one time Capacity Charge of $5.9 million from a dewatering </br></br>project at the San Diego Convention Center. The Department projects that $5.0 million will be </br></br>generated in Fiscal Year 2010. The Capacity Charge revenue projections for Fiscal Years 2011 </br></br>and through Fiscal Year 2014 assume an average annual growth rate of approximately 1% in </br></br>EDUs.  </br> </br>The Department has also considered the effects of the housing market on the other </br>components of System Revenues  including revenues generated from sewer service charges. </br></br>Notwithstanding housing foreclosures and related account closings  usage of the Wastewater </br></br>System has remained stable. Accordingly  the Department expects that the current housing </br></br>conditions will not adversely affect the ability of the Wastewater System to generate Net </br></br>System Revenues sufficient to pay the 2010A Installment Payments. However  the City cannot </br></br>predict the extent to which the current or any future financial crisis will impact its ability to </br></br>generate Net System Revenues in the amounts required by the Installment Purchase Agreement </br></br>to pay 2010A Installment Payments. In particular  the City cannot predict the extent to which </br></br>an economic recession and credit crisis will affect f</br>uture wastewater flow  the impact of any </br>reduced demand on the Wastewater System’s finances and operations or whether a sustained </br></br>fiscal crisis would create sufficient pressure on the City to effect a reduction in sewer fees. </br> Acceleration; Limitations on Remedies </br> </br>The Indenture provides that  upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default </br>thereunder  the Trustee may  subject to certain conditions  declare the principal of all Bonds  </br></br>including the Series 2010A Bonds  then Outstanding and the interest accrued thereon to be due </br></br>and payable immediately. The foregoing notwithstanding  the remedy of acceleration is subject </br></br>to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State  including a limitation on </br></br>enforcement obligations against funds needed to serve the public welfare and interest. Also  </br></br>any remedies available to the Owners of the Series 2010A Bonds upon the occurrence of an </br></br>Event of Default under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions </br></br>which are often subject to discretion and delay and could prove both expensive and time </br></br>consuming to obtain. </br> </br>Further  enforceability of the rights and remedies of the Owners of the Series </br>2010A Bonds  and the obligations incurred by the City  may become subject to the Federal bankruptcy </br></br>code and applicable bankruptcy  insolvency  reorganization  moratorium  or similar laws </br></br>relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditor’s rights generally  now or hereafter in effect  </br></br>equity principles which may limit the specific enforcement under State law of certain remedies  </br></br>the exercise by the United States of America of the powers delegated to it by the Constitution  </br></br>the reasonable and necessary exercise  in certain exceptional situations  of the police powers </br></br>inherent in the sovereignty of the State and its governmental bodies in the interest of serving a </br></br>significant and legitimate public purpose  and the limitations on remedies against counties in </br></br>the State. Bankruptcy proceedings  or the exercise of powers by the Federal or State </br></br>government  if initiated  could subject the Owners of the Series 2010A Bonds to judicial </br></br>discretion and interpretation of their rights in bankruptcy or otherwise and consequently may </br></br>entail risks of delay  limitation  or modification of their rights. </br> </br>  77  </br>CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND  </br>WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES </br> Article XIIIA </br> Article XIIIA of the State Constitution provides that the maximum ad valorem tax on </br>real property cannot exceed 1% of the “full cash value ” which is defined as “the county </br></br>assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975 76 tax b</br>ill under ‘full cash value’ </br>or  thereafter  the appraised value of real property when purchased  newly constructed  or a </br></br>change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment ” subject to exceptions for certain </br></br>circumstances of transfer or reconstruction and except with respect to certain voter approved </br></br>debt. The “full cash value” is subject to annual adjustment to reflect increases  not to exceed </br></br>2% per year  or decreases in the consumer price index or comparable local data  or to reflect </br></br>reduction in property value caused by damage  destruction or other factors. </br> </br>Article XIIIA requires a vote of two thirds of the qualified electorate to impose special </br>taxes  while generally precluding the imposition of any additional ad valorem  sales or </br></br>transaction tax on real property. As amended  Article XIIIA exempts from the 1% tax </br></br>limitation any taxes above that level required to pay debt service on certain voter approved </br></br>general obligation bonds for the acquisition or improvement of real property. In addition  </br></br>Article XIIIA requires the approval of two thirds of all members of the State Legislature to </br></br>change any State laws resulting in increased tax revenues. </br> </br>Under California law  any fee which exceeds the reasonable cost of providing the service </br>for which the fee is charged is a “special tax ” which under Article XIIIA must be authorized </br></br>by a two thirds vote of the electorate. Accordingly  if a portion of the City’s water or sewer </br></br>user rates or Capacity Fees were determined by a court to exceed the reasonable cost of </br></br>providing service  the City would not be permitted to continue to collect that portion unless it </br></br>were authorized to do so by a two thirds majority of the votes cast in an election to authorize </br></br>the collection of that portion of the rates or fees. The reasonable cost of providing wastewater </br></br>services has been determined by the State Controller to include depreciation and allowance for </br></br>the cost of capital improvements. In addition  the California courts have determined that fees </br></br>such as capacity fees will not be special taxes if they approximate the reasonable cost of </br></br>constructing the water or wastewater capital improvements contemplated by the local agency </br></br>imposing the fee. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Historical </br></br>Revenues and Expenses.” </br> Article XIIIB </br> </br>Article XIIIB of the California Constitution limits the annual appropriations of </br>proceeds of taxes by State and local government entities to the amount of appropriations of </br></br>the entity for the prior fiscal year  as adjusted for changes in the cost of living  changes in </br></br>population and changes in services rendered by the entity. User fees and charges are </br></br>considered proceeds of taxes only to the extent they exceed the reasonable costs incurred by a </br></br>governmental entity in supplying the goods and services for which such fees and charges are </br></br>imposed. </br> </br>To the extent that assessments  fee and charges collected by the City are used to pay </br>the costs of maintaining and operating the Wastewater System and payments due on the </br></br>Series 2010A Bonds  including the funding of the Reserve Fund   the City believes that such </br></br>moneys are not subject to the annual appropriations limit of Article XIIIB. </br>  78  </br>Articles XIIIC and XIIID </br> On November 5  1996  the voters of the State approved Proposition 218  a </br>constitutional initiative  entitled the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act”  “Proposition 218” . </br></br>Proposition 218 added Articles X</br>IIIC and XIIID to the California Constitution and contained a </br>number of interrelated provisions affecting the ability of local governments  including the City  </br></br>to levy and collect both existing and future taxes  assessments  fees and charges. </br> </br>Section 1 of Article XIIIC requires majority voter approval for the imposition  extension </br>or increase of general taxes and Section 2 thereof requires two thirds voter approval for the </br></br>imposition  extension or increase of special taxes. These voter approval requirements of Article </br></br>XIIIC reduce the flexib</br>ility of the City to raise revenues by the levy of general or special taxes </br>and  given such voter approval requirements  no assurance can be given that the City will be </br></br>able to enact  impose  extend or increase any such taxes in the future to meet increased </br></br>expenditure requirements. The City has not enacted  imposed  extended or increased any tax </br></br>since the effective date of Proposition 218. </br> </br>Section 3 of Article XIIIC expressly extends the initiative power to give voters the power </br>to reduce or repeal local taxes  assessments  fees and charges  regardless of the date such </br></br>taxes  assessments  fees or charges were imposed. Section 3 expands the initiative power to </br></br>include reducing or repealing assessments  fees and charges  which had previously been </br></br>considered administrative rather than legislative matters and therefore beyond the initiative </br></br>power. This extension of the initiative power is not limited by the terms of Article XIIIC to fees </br></br>imposed after November 6  1996  the effective date of Proposition 218  and absent other legal </br></br>authority could result in the reduction in any existing taxes  assessments or fees and charges </br></br>imposed prior to November 6  1996. </br> </br>“Fees” and “charges” are not expressly defined in Article XIIIC or in SB </br>919  the </br>Proposition 218 Omnibus Implementation Act enacted in 1997 to prescribe specific procedures </br></br>and parameters for local jurisdictions in complying with Article XIIIC and Article XIIID  “SB </br></br>919” . However  on July 24  2006  the California Supreme Court ruled in </br>Bighorn Desert View </br></br>Water Agency v. Virjil  Kelley </br>  the “Bighorn Decision”  that charges for ongoing water delivery </br>are property related fees and charges within the meaning of Article XIIID and are also fees or </br></br>charges within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIIIC. The California Supreme Court held </br></br>that such water service charges may  therefore  be reduced or repealed through a local voter </br></br>initiative pursuant to Section 3 of Article XIIIC.  </br> </br>In the Bighorn Decision  the Supreme Court did state that nothing in Section 3 of Article </br>XIIIC authorizes initiative measures that impose voter approval requirements for f</br>uture </br>increases in fees or charges for water delivery. The Supreme Court stated that water providers </br></br>may determine rates and charges upon proper action of the governing body and that the </br></br>governing body may increase a charge which was not affected by a prior initiative or impose an </br></br>entirely new charge.  </br> </br>The Supreme Court further stated in the Bighorn Decision that it was not holding that </br>the initiative power is free of all limitations and was not determining whether the initiative </br></br>power is subject to the statutory provision requiring that water and wastewater service charges </br></br>be set at a level that will pay debt service on bonded debt and operating expenses. Such </br></br>initiative power could be subject to the limitations imposed on the impairment of contracts </br></br>under the contract clause of the United States Constitution. Additionally  SB 919 provides that </br></br>the initiative power provided for in Proposition 218 “shall not be construed to mean that any </br></br>owner or beneficial owner of a municipal security  purchased before or after  the effective date </br></br>of Proposition 218  assumes the risk of  or in any way consents to  any action by initiative </br></br>measure that constitutes an impairment of contractual rights” protected by the United States </br> 79  </br>Constitution. No assurance can be given that the voters of the City w</br>ill not  in the f</br>uture  </br>approve initiatives which repeal  reduce or prohibit the future imposition or increase of </br>assessments  fees or charges  including the City’s sewer service fees and charges  which are the </br></br>source of Net System Revenues pledged to the payment of debt service on Series 2008 Bonds </br></br>and other Outstanding Obligations. </br> </br>Notwithstanding the fact that sewer service charges may be subject to reduction or </br>repeal by voter initiative undertaken pursuant to Section 3 of Article XIIIC  the City has </br></br>covenanted to levy and charge rates which meet the requirements of the Installment Purchase </br></br>Agreement in accordance with applicable law.  </br> </br>Article XIIID defines a “fee” or “charge” as any levy other than an ad valorem tax  </br>special tax  or assessment imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property </br></br>ownership  including a user fee or charge for a property related service. A “property related </br></br>service” is defined as “a public service having a direct relationship to a property ownership.” </br></br>In the Bighorn Decision  the California Supreme Court held that a public water agency’s </br></br>charges for ongoing water delivery are fees and charges within the meaning of Article XIIID. </br></br>Article XIIID requires that any agency imposing or increasing any property related fee or </br></br>charge must provide written notice thereof to the record owner of each identified parcel upon </br></br>which such fee or charge is to be imposed and must conduct a public hearing with respect </br></br>thereto. The proposed fee or charge may not be imposed or increased if a majority of owners of </br></br>the identified parcels file written protests against it. As a result  the local government’s ability </br></br>to increase such fee or charge may be limited by a majority protest. </br> </br>In addition  Article XIIID also includes a number of limitations applicable to existing </br>fees and charges including provisions to the effect that  i  revenues derived from the fee or </br></br>charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service;  ii  such </br></br>revenues shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was </br></br>imposed;  iii  the amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident </br></br>of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the </br></br>parcel; and  iv  no such fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is </br></br>actually used by  or immediately available to  the owner of the property in question. Property </br></br>related fees or charges based on potential or future use of a service are not permitted. </br> </br>The City’s current sewer rates comply with the notice and substantive provisions of </br>Article XIIID. Three lawsuits filed against the City challenging the sewer rates as they were </br></br>structured prior to October 2004  before the City incorporated a COD component. The Shames </br></br>Settlement resulted in a $35 m</br>illion rebate to eligible single family residential customers and $5 </br>million in attorneys’ fees  as discussed previously under Wastewater System Financial </br></br>Operations. The two other lawsuits were filed on behalf of local restaurants and multifamily </br></br>residential customers are still pending. See “LITIGATION” for a description of the two </br></br>lawsuits. </br> </br>Article XIIID establishes procedural requirements for the imposition of assessments  </br>which are defined as any charge upon real property for a special benefit conferred upon the </br></br>real property. Standby charges are classified as assessments. Procedural requirements for </br></br>assessments under Article XIIID include conducting a public hearing and mailed protest </br></br>procedure  with notice to the record owner of each parcel subject to the assessment. The </br></br>assessment may not be imposed if a majority of the ballots returned oppose the assessment  </br></br>with each ballot weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected </br></br>parcel. To provide guidance to City staff regarding the conduct of Proposition 218 “property </br></br>related fee” protest proceedings  the City Council adopted Resolution R 302245 in January </br></br>2007 establishing additional procedures for submitting protests against proposed increases to </br></br>sewer rates  including the provision of notice of a proposed change in sewer fees to all owners </br> 80  </br>of record on each identified parcel and all wastewater customers of the City as reflected in the </br>billing records of the City at the time the notice is given  and additional procedures for the </br></br>tabulation of protests against proposed increases to sewer service charges  including guidelines </br></br>for determining when a valid protest has been submitted.  </br> </br>The City and the City Attorney are of the opinion that current sewer fees and charges </br>that are subject to Proposition 218 comply with the provisions thereof and that the City w</br>ill continue to comply with the rate covenant set forth in the Installment Purchase Agreement in </br></br>conformity with the provisions of Article XIIID of the California State Consti</br>tution. Should it </br>become necessary to increase the sewer fees and charges above current levels  the City would </br></br>be required to comply with the requirements of Article XIIID in connection with such proposed </br></br>increase. Under existing standards  the City and the City Attorney are of the opinion that rates </br></br>and charges may be established at levels which would permit deposits to a Rate Stabilization </br></br>Fund or maintenance of uncommitted cash reserves. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial Projections.” </br> </br>The interpretation and application of Proposition 218 w</br>ill ultimately be determined by </br>the courts or through implementing legislation with respect to a number of the matters </br></br>described above  and it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the outcome of </br></br>such determination or the nature or scope of any such legislation. </br> </br> TAX MATTERS </br> </br>Federal tax law contains a number of requirements and restrictions which apply to the </br>Series 2010A Bonds  including investment restrictions  periodic payments of arbitrage profits </br></br>to the United States  requirements regarding the proper use of bond proceeds and the facilities </br></br>financed therewith  and certain other matters. The Authority and the City have covenanted to </br></br>comply with all requirements that must be satisfied in order for the interest on the Series 2010 </br></br>Bonds to be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Failure to comply </br></br>with certain of such covenants could cause interest on the Series 2010 Bonds to become </br></br>includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance </br></br>of the Series 2010 Bonds. </br> </br>Subject to the Authority’s and the City’s compliance with the above referenced </br>covenants  under present law  in the opinion of Quint &amp; Thimmig LLP  Bond Counsel  interest </br></br>on the Series 2010 Bonds  i  is excludable from the gross income of the owners thereof for </br></br>federal income tax purposes  and  ii  is not included as an item of tax preference in computing </br></br>the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations  but interest on the Series </br></br>2010 Bonds is taken into account  however  in computing an adjustment used in determining </br></br>the federal alternative minimum tax for certain corporations. </br> </br>Bond Counsel expects to deliver an opinion at the time of delivery of the Series 2010 </br>Bonds in substantially the form set forth in APPENDIX C—”FORM OF BOND COUNSEL’S </br></br>OPINION.” </br> </br>Bond Counsel’s opinion represents its legal judgment based upon its review of the law </br>and the facts that it deems relevant to render such opinion and is not a guarantee of a result. </br> </br>The Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended  the “Code”   includes provisions for </br>an alternative minimum tax  “AMT”  for corporations in addition to the corporate regular tax </br></br>in certain cases. The AMT  if any  depends upon the corporation’s alternative minimum </br></br>taxable income  “AMTI”   which is the corporation’s taxable income with certain adjustments. </br> 81  </br>One of the adjustment items used in computing the AMTI of a corporation  with certain </br>exceptions  is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation’s “adjusted current </br></br>earnings” over an amount equal to its AMTI  before such adjustment item and the alternative </br></br>tax net operating loss deduction . “Adjusted current earnings” would include certain tax </br></br>exempt interest  including interest on the Series 2010A Bonds. </br> </br>Ownership of the Series 2010A Bonds may result in collateral federal income tax </br>consequences to certain taxpayers  including  without limitation  corporations subject to the </br></br>branch profits tax  financial institutions  certain insurance companies  certain S corporations  </br></br>individual recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and taxpayers who may </br></br>be deemed to have incurred  or continued  indebtedness to purchase or carry tax exempt </br></br>obligations. Prospective purchasers of the Series 2010 Bonds should consult their tax advisors </br></br>as to applicability of any such collateral consequences. </br> </br>The issue price  the “Issue Price”  for each maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds is the </br>price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds is first sold to </br></br>the public. The Issue Price of a maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds may be different from the </br></br>price set forth  or the price corresponding to the yield set forth  on the cover page hereof. </br> </br>If the Issue Price of a maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds is less than the principal </br>amount payable at maturity  the difference between the Issue Price of each such maturity  if </br></br>any  of the Series 2010 Bonds  the “OID Bonds”  and the principal amount payable at </br></br>maturity is original issue discount. </br> </br>For an investor who purchases an OID Bond in the initial public offering at the Issue </br>Price for such maturity and who holds such OID Bond to its stated maturity  subject to the </br></br>condition that the Authority and the City comply with the covenants discussed above   a  the </br></br>full amount of original issue discount with respect to such OID Bond constitutes interest </br></br>which is excludable from the gross income of the owner thereof for federal income tax </br></br>purposes;  b  such owner will not realize taxable capital gain or market discount upon </br></br>payment of such OID Bond at its stated maturity;  c  such original issue discount is not </br></br>included as an item of tax preference in computing the alternative minimum tax for </br></br>individuals and corporations under the Code  but is taken into account in computing an </br></br>adjustment used in determining the alternative minimum tax for certain corporations under </br></br>the Code  as described above; and  d  the accretion of original issue discount in each year may </br></br>result in an alternative minimum tax liability for corporations or certain other collateral federal </br></br>income tax consequences in each year even though a corresponding cash payment may not be </br></br>received until a later year. Owners of OID Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with </br></br>respect to the state and local tax consequences of original issue discount on such OID Bonds. </br> </br>Owners of Bonds who dispose of Bonds prior to the stated maturity  whether by sale  </br>redemption or otherwise   purchase Bonds in the initial public offering  but at a price different </br></br>from the Issue Price or purchase Bonds subsequent to the initial public offering should consult </br></br>their own tax advisors. </br> </br>If a Bond is purchased at any time for a price that is less than the Bond’s stated </br>redemption price at maturity or  in the case of an OID Bond  its Issue Price plus accreted </br></br>original issue discount reduced by payments of interest included in the computation of </br></br>original issue discount and previously paid  the “Revised Issue Price”   the purchaser will be </br></br>treated as having purchased a Series 2010A Bond with market discount subject to the market </br></br>discount rules of the Code  unless a statutory de minimis rule applies . Accrued market </br></br>discount is treated as taxable ordinary income and is recognized when a Bond is disposed of </br></br> to the extent such accrued discount does not exceed gain realized  or  at the purchaser’s </br></br>election  as it accrues. Such treatment would apply to any purchaser who purchases an OID </br> 82  </br>Bond for a price that is less than its Revised Issue Price even if the purchase price exceeds par. </br>The applicability of the market discount rules may adversely affect the liquidity or secondary </br></br>market price of such Bond. Purchasers should consult their own tax advisors regarding the </br></br>potential implications of market discount with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds. </br> </br>An investor may purchase a Series 2010A Bond at a price in excess of its stated </br>principal amount. Such excess is characterized for federal income tax purposes as “bond </br></br>premium” and must be amortized by an investor on a constant yield basis over the remaining </br></br>term of the Bond in a manner that takes into account potential call dates and call prices. An </br></br>investor cannot deduct amortized bond premium relating to a tax exempt bond. The </br></br>amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the tax exempt interest received. As </br></br>bond premium is amortized  it reduces the investor’s basis in the Bond. Investors who </br></br>purchase a Bond at a premium should consult their own tax advisors regarding the </br></br>amortization of bond premium and its effect on the Bond’s basis for purposes of computing </br></br>gain or loss in connection with the sale  exchange  redemption or early retirement of the Bond. </br> </br>There are or may be pending in the Congress of the United States legislative proposals  </br>including some that carry retroactive effective dates  that  if enacted  could alter or amend the </br></br>federal tax matters referred to above or affect the market value of the Series 2010 Bonds. It </br></br>cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such proposal might be enacted or whether  if </br></br>enacted  it would apply to bonds issued prior to enactment. Prospective purchasers of the </br></br>Series 2010 Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed </br></br>federal tax legislation. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any pending or proposed </br></br>federal tax legislation. </br> </br>The Internal Revenue Service  the “Service”  has an ongoing program of auditing tax </br>exempt obligations to determine whether  in the view of the Service  interest on such tax </br></br>exempt obligations is includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income </br></br>tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the Service will commence an audit of the </br></br>Series 2010 Bonds. If an audit is commenced  under current procedures the Service may treat </br></br>the Authority as a taxpayer and the Bondholders may have no right to participate in such </br></br>procedure. The commencement of an audit could adversely affect the market value and </br></br>liquidity of the Series 2010 Bonds until the audit is concluded  regardless of the ultimate </br></br>outcome. </br> </br>Payments of interest on  and proceeds of the sale  redemption or maturity of  tax </br>exempt obligations  including the Series 2010 Bonds  are in certain cases required to be </br></br>reported to the Service. Additionally  backup withholding may apply to any such payments to </br></br>any Bond owner who fails to provide an accurate Form W 9 Request for Taxpayer </br></br>Identification Number and Certification  or a substantially identical form  or to any Bond </br></br>owner who is notified by the Service of a failure to report any interest or dividends required to </br></br>be shown on federal income tax returns. The reporting and backup withholding requirements </br></br>do not affect the excludability of such interest from gross income for federal tax purposes. </br> </br>The Bonds are issued to refund bonds issued before January 1  2009  and therefore are </br>treated as issued before 2009 for purposes of section 265 b  7  of the Code relating to interest </br></br>expense deductibility for financial institutions. The treatment of interest expense for financial </br></br>institutions owning such Bonds may be less favorable than the treatment provided to owners </br></br>of tax exempt bonds treated as issued in 2009 or 2010. Financial institutions should consult </br></br>their tax advisors concerning such treatment. </br> </br>In the further opinion of Bond Counsel  interest on the Series 2010A Bonds is exempt </br>from California personal income taxes. </br>  83  </br>Ownership of the Series 2010A Bonds may result in other state and local tax </br>consequences to certain taxpayers. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such </br>collateral consequences arising with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds. Prospective purchasers </br></br>of the Series 2010 Bonds should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicab</br>ility of any </br>such state and local taxes. </br> </br> CONTINUING DISCLOSURE </br> </br>Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Certificate of the City  the “Disclosure </br>Certificate”   the City has agreed to provide  or cause to be provided  to Municipal Securities </br></br>Rulemaking Board in the manner prescribed by the Securities Exchange Commission certain </br></br>annual financial information and operating data concerning the City. The annual report to be </br></br>filed by the City is to be filed not later than 270 days following the end of the City’s Fiscal Year </br></br> currently June 30   commencing with the Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2009  and is to include </br></br>audited financial statements of the City.  </br> </br>Beginning in March 2004  the City failed to comply with undertakings related to 21 </br>bond issues for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 due to the unavailab</br>ility of the City’s </br>audited financial statements. The circumstances regarding the unavailability of the City’s </br></br>audited financial statements are described under the caption entitled “INTRODUCTION—</br></br>Certain Information Regarding the City.” Each required annual report and audited financial </br></br>statement was subsequently filed. Prior to March 2004  the City had never failed to comply </br></br>with its undertakings with regard to Rule 15c2 12.  </br> </br>The City has timely filed the annual reports and financial statements for Fiscal Year </br>2008 with respect to securities secured by the Sewer Revenue Fund  the Water Ut</br>ility Fund and </br>the City’s General Fund. The City Council received and filed the fiscal year 2009 audited </br></br>financial statements on February 1  2010  and the corresponding continuing disclosure f</br>ilings </br>were made on March 25  2010.  </br> </br>The City’s covenants in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate have been made in order </br>to assist the Underwriters in complying with the Rule. A failure by the City to comply with any </br></br>of the covenants therein is not an event of default under the Indenture.  </br> </br> LITIGATION </br> </br>There is no litigation pending against the City or  to the knowledge of its respective </br>executive officers  threatened  seeking to restrain or enjoin the issuance  sale  execution or </br></br>delivery of the Series 2010A Bonds or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of the </br></br>Series 2010A Bonds or the Authorizations or any proceedings of the City taken with respect to </br></br>the issuance or sale thereof  or the pledge or application of any moneys or security provided </br></br>for the payment of the Series 2010A Bonds or the use of the proceeds of the Series 2010A </br></br>Bonds. </br> </br>There are no pending lawsuits that  in the opinion of the City Attorney  challenge the </br>validity of the above issue  the corporate existence of the City  or the title of the executive </br></br>officers to their respective offices. In connection with this review  attention has been given to </br></br>not only litigation pending against the City  but also litigation pending against the </br></br>Department. The Office of the City Attorney has prepared the following summary  as of </br></br>May 14  2009  certain claims and lawsuits  for which the estimated loss to the City as of such </br></br>date exceeds $1 million  “Material Litigation”   pending against the Sewer Revenue Fund for </br> 84  </br>construction claims and certain other alleged liabilities arising during the ordinary course of </br>operations of the Wastewater System: </br> </br>• There are two class action lawsuits pending  each alleging that the City failed </br>to include a COD cost component in the sewer rate structure prior to October 2004  </br></br>which led to overcharges on sewer fees for certain customer groups that were </br></br>disproportionate to the cost of service for such customer groups. While the allegations </br></br>in both lawsuits are similar to those set forth in Shames  a class action lawsuit on </br></br>behalf of all single family residential account holders that was settled in 2007  see </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—City Council Actions </br></br>Relating to Sewer Rate Changes”   the City’s defenses and potential liability relative to </br></br>the two pending lawsuits are different from those in Shames. </br>  California </br>Restaurant Management System v. City of San Diego</br>. Plaintiffs </br>filed this class action case on August 20  2007 on behalf of local food </br></br>establishments  alleging that from 1994 to 2004 the City failed to properly </br></br>calculate the food establishments’ proportionate impact on the cost of operating </br></br>and maintaining the Wastewater System and seeking to recover their alleged </br></br>overpayment. The class was certified by the court on May 15  2009. The Court </br></br>granted the City s motion for summary judgment in October  2009  ending the </br></br>case without liability to the City. Plaintiffs have appealed the Court’s decision. </br></br>In the event of a successful appeal and an adverse ruling the City estimates the </br></br>liability could range from $0 to $5 million. </br>  Edmond A. Vigneau v. City of San Diego</br>. Plaintiffs filed this case on </br>September 17  2008 on behalf of multifamily residential customers  alleging the </br></br>City overcharged them for sewer service from 2000 to 2004  before the City </br></br>incorporated a COD component. Notwithstanding the absence of a COD cost </br></br>component  the City believes that the plaintiffs may have been undercharged </br></br>because other aspects of the pre October 2004 sewer rate for this customer </br></br>group  including the base fee for service  may have been too low. The Court </br></br>denied plaintiff s request for class action status in November 2009  keeping only </br></br>the named plaintiffs in the case and substantially reducing the City s potential </br></br>liability. It is unknown whether plaintiffs will appeal the decision. In the event of </br></br>a successful appeal and an adverse ruling the City estimates the liability could </br></br>range from $0 to $5 million  but the City anticipates the plaintiffs’ likelihood of </br></br>successfully proving overages is remote. </br></br> </br>• Timothy Cresto  et al. v. Taylor Woodrow Homes  Inc.  et al; Christopher Smith  et </br>al. v. Taylor Woodrow Homes  et al</br>. On August 21  2007  two sets of plaintiffs filed </br>lawsuits alleging that the City  Taylor Woodrow Homes  Inc. and certain other related </br></br>parties effected an inverse condemnation of and caused dangerous conditions on their </br></br>respective properties in a housing development known as Santaluz  by contributing to </br></br>the plaintiffs’ exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas  which allegedly emanated from the </br></br>Wastewater System. The cases have been coordinated for discovery and settlement </br></br>purposes. In the event of an adverse ruling  the City estimates the aggregate liability </br></br>resulting from these two cases could range from $0 to $20 million. The City has filed </br></br>cross complaints against the developer  the design engineer and the contractors seeking </br></br>indemnity for any damages that may be awarded to the plaintiffs. </br></br>  The Grande North at Santa Fe Place HOA v. Bosa Development  et al</br>. In </br>September 2009  plaintiff HOA filed a lawsuit against the City alleging that high levels </br></br>of hydrogen sulfide gas from the City s sewer system have corroded and damaged the </br> 85  </br>building s plumbing. Plaintiff claims the City s sewer system is defective because it </br>does not include an “odorless connection” where the HOA s sewer lateral connects to </br></br>the City s trunk sewer. The City s potential liability is currently unknown  as the City </br></br>has yet to learn the extent of the damage to plaintiff s plumbing  if any  allegedly </br></br>caused by hydrogen sulfide gas. Liability could be significant  if it is determined that </br></br>the plumbing to all 221 condominium units needs to be replaced. </br></br>  The Grande South at Santa Fe Place HOA v. Bosa Development  et al. </br>In February  </br>2010  the City was served with a lawsuit with the same allegations as The Grande </br></br>North  but for its sister development The Grande South. The allegations and potential </br></br>liability are the same in both cases. </br> The City believes it has sufficient defenses against such claims and lawsuits and in no </br>event should these claims and lawsuits result in judgments or settlements which  in the </br></br>aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on the Sewer Revenue Fund’s financial </br></br>position. </br> </br> LEGAL OPINION </br> </br>The validity of the Series 2010A Bonds and certain other matters are subject to the </br>approving opinion of Quint &amp; Thimmig LLP  San Francisco  California  Bond Counsel.

EGS consists of two </br></br>focused work units: t</br>he Business Expansion  Attraction  and Retention Team and the </br>Government Incentives Team.</br>  </br>These two teams work directly with businesses  business </br>organizations  and City departments to create a business</br> friendly environment that </br>promotes</br> a stable economy.</br>  </br>Economic growth  energy independence  revenue </br>enhancement  and community revitalization are accomplished by attracting new companies  </br></br>retaining and or expanding existing companies  making San Diego competitive in emerging </br>markets  and revitalizing older </br>business communities.</br>   </br> 12CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Due to the economic downturn</br>  </br>Economic Growth Services has placed a strong emphasis on </br>its </br>business retention mission.</br>   In fiscal year 2009 EGS developed and executed successful </br>business retention efforts for Sony Electronics  Cri</br>cket Corporation  Circle Foods  Lockheed </br>Martin  Eli Lilly  and Camel</br>Bak.  </br>These efforts resulted in the creation or retention of </br>approximately 2 900</br> San Diego based jobs.</br>  </br>In the current fiscal year  EGS worked with </br>Alliant Techsystems  Inc to retain or create 200 San Diego based jobs.</br>  </br>The capital </br>investments made by the companies EGS assisted in fiscal year</br> 2009 and fiscal year</br> 2010 </br>represent a cumulative investment of more than $368 million of construction and renovation </br>activity for our local economy.   </br> The ﬁCertificate of Deposit Account Registry Serviceﬂ  CDARS  is a deposit</br> placement </br>service designed to allow FDIC</br> insured depository institutions to accept deposits of more </br>than $100 000  currently $250 000  and obtain full coverage for the depositor </br>by spreading </br>the funds among as many separate FDIC insured institutions as necessary so that no </br>institution holds more than $250 000  principal plus interest  for each depositor.  </br>To support local reinvestment  the City increased its CDARS</br> investment from </br>$5 million to $15 </br>million in </br>fiscal y</br>ear 2009. The City plans to increase the allowable investment in the CDARS </br>program to approximately $40 million in </br>fiscal y</br>ear 2010.</br>   The authorized CDARS </br>investment program allows the City to invest millions of dollar</br>s into fully insured FDIC non</br> negotiable certificates of deposit.  </br>The initial deposit is split among small community banks </br>throughout the country so that any single Certificate of Deposit at a financial institution </br></br>does not exceed the $250 000 FDIC insura</br>nce limit.</br>  The banks participating </br>in the</br> CDARS </br>network send an equal</br> amount of funds</br> back to local San Diego bank</br>s </br>to ensure th</br>at they</br> retain</br> funds equal to the City s initial</br> deposit</br> for</br> reinvestment </br>in the local community.</br>  </br>The </br>City™s investment in the</br> CDARS program assures that the full amount deposited at local </br>banks stay</br>s </br>in San Diego for</br> reinvestment in the community.</br>    </br> </br>According to the stimulus tracking website Recovery.org  California received more American </br>Recovery and Reinvestment Act  ARRA  dollars than any other state and the San Diego </br>region received the second largest total of stimulus dollars of any region in California </br> trailing Los Angeles .  As of November 19  2009  the San Diego region received 201 </br>projects totaling over $2.1 billion. </br> The City of San Diego can expect to see at least $340 </br>million in stimulus funding. Of this amount  approximately $290 million is for Federal </br>projects and will not come directly through the City; the remaining $50 million is expected </br></br>to come to the City ov</br>er the next six months. Projects including the modernization of Otay </br>Mesa™s Port of Entry and the San Ysidro border expansion project will alleviate congestion </br></br>and improve the productivity and efficiency of US Mexico border relations.  This money will </br></br>come</br> either directly to the City in the form of block grants and competitive awards  $49 </br>million  or to our partner agencies in which the City participates  such as </br>the San Diego </br>Association of Governments and the San Diego Workforce Partnership  $126 million </br>  or to </br>federal agencies pursuing major construction projects within the City of San Diego  $164 </br></br>million not including military projects .  These ARRA funds will be used on transportation  </br>housing  public safety and energy projects that will not only creat</br>e jobs but will provide long </br>term benefits for the City and the region. </br> Fiscal Challenges</br>   </br>The City of San Diego has faced significant financial challenges over the last several years </br>and has made a determined effort to improve its overall financial </br>condition</br> and </br>the quality </br>of its financial statements  internal controls</br>  and d</br>isclosure controls and procedures.  A few </br>of the City™s achievements include  1  the release of audited financial statements for </br>fiscal </br>year</br>s 2003</br> 2008 </br>in a two year period</br>;  2  the implementation of an annual five</br> year </br>13CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>financial outlook as a prudent planning tool;  3  the strengthening of the City™s General </br>Fund reserves;  4  fully funding the Annual Required Contribution  ARC  to the City™s </br>pension system</br> since fiscal year</br> 2006</br>;  5  new pension plan</br>s for police and</br> for non</br> public </br>safety employees hired on or after July 1  2009;  6  participation in a California Public </br>Employees™ Retirement System  CALPERs  trust for pre</br> funding of post</br> employment </br>healthcare benefits for ret</br>ired City employees;  7  rating upgrades from the national rating </br>agencies  including  in the case of one agency  the reinstatement of the City™s credit rating</br>; </br>and  8  re</br> entering the public bond market in 2009 </br>and issuing $1.6 billion in debt</br>  new </br>money </br>and refunding </br> after a five year absence.</br>  The City issued the Fiscal Year 2010 First Quarter Budget Monitoring Report on November </br>17  2009  which</br> presented a review of actual expenditures and receipts through September </br>2009 and projects annual expenditure</br>s and revenues for the General Fund through year </br>end. Based on this analysis  the City expects a shortfall of approximately $7.5 million in </br></br>fiscal year 2010</br>  </br>primarily as a result of declining sales tax and T</br>ransient Occupancy Tax </br> TOT  revenues.</br> The decline in major revenues is partially offset by conservative spending </br>and a hiring freeze that has been in effect since August 2009.</br>  </br>The Five Year Financial Outlook  Outlook  issued on October 1  2009  identified a projected </br></br>deficit for fiscal year 2011 of $179 million. The sensitivity analysis in the Outlook estimates </br>a deficit range of $168 to $200 million  primarily resulting from the possible fluctuation of </br>three major revenues: property tax; sales tax; and TOT. On November 24  the Mayor </br></br>presented a propos</br>ed 18 month budget for the remainder of fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year </br>2011 to remediate the projected fiscal year 2011 deficit of $179 million. On December 14  </br>2009 the City Council adopted the fiscal year 2010 budget revisions and the fiscal year 2011 </br>proposed budget.  The fiscal year 2011 budget framework approved by the City Council </br></br>includes a combination of transfers  new revenue  and annual expenditure reductions that </br></br>will impact services to City residents.  Further action  including labor negotiati</br>ons and </br>additional City Council approval  will be necessary to implement all recommended </br>adjustments. If the budget is implemented on January 1  2010 as recommended  savings of </br>approximately $24 million in fiscal year 2010 will be set aside to assist in ba</br>lancing the </br>fiscal year 2011 budget.</br>  </br>The City </br>publicly</br> issued</br> a </br>$125 million Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes  </br>TRAN  </br>on July </br>1  2009 and does</br> not </br>currently </br>foresee the need to issue additional notes to meet any </br>General Fund liquidity needs </br>for the </br>remainder</br> of fiscal year</br> 2010</br>. </br>The City treasury holds </br>approximately $2 billion that is invested primarily in US Treasuries and agencies  and </br></br>consistent with the City™s investment policy  has sufficient liquidity to meet all currently </br>foreseeable cash demands. </br> The General Fund reserves are approximately $</br>79 million</br> as of </br>the issuance of this report</br>  which includes $55 million set aside in an Emergency Reserve </br>Fund that can be accessed by a two</br> thirds vote of City Council. </br>  </br>Readers of these financial statements</br> should pay particular attention to Notes 12  13  18  </br>and 22  concerning Pension Plans  Other Post Employment Benefits  Contingencies  and </br>Subsequent Events  respectively.

These expenses </br>supported all public services and the </br>significant fiscal obligations of the City  </br></br>including funding of the City™s pension </br>system  post</br> employment healthcare </br>benefits  and </br>capital improvements</br>.  Total </br>expenses for fiscal year 2009 were $2.</br>5 </br>billion</br>. Governmental activities were $1.7 </br>billion  of which 38% </br>was spent on public </br>safety for police</br>  </br>fire</br>  </br>and life safety services. </br>Business type activities </br>were $.8 billion</br>  of </br>which </br>85% of these expenses were for water </br>and wastewater expenses. </br> The City™s unfunded pension </br>liability remains a significant </br>obligation of the City.  The </br></br>City has aggressively </br>confronted this deficit  fully </br>funding the City™s Annual </br></br>Required Contribution  ARC  </br></br>beginning in fiscal year 2006  </br>and h</br>as made significant </br>additional payments in </br>excess of the ARC into the pension fund</br> in certain years.  The San Diego City Employee</br>s™ Retirement System  SDCERS  is the administrator of </br>the City™s</br> employee pension funds.  On </br>an annual basis  the pension fund portfolio and future pension obligations are evaluated by </br></br>an independent actuary to determine the full pension liability.  The June 30  200</br>8 valuation </br>calculated the unfunded pension liability to be approximately $1.303 billion. </br>The June 30  </br>2009 actuarial report is not complete as of the issuance of this report.</br> In fiscal year 2009</br>  </br>the global financial markets experienced significant declines.  The </br>effects of the market declines have been wide ranging and impact even the most diversified </br></br>investment portfolios. The S</br>DCERS investment portfolio is no exception. SDCERS employs a </br>long</br> term investment strategy.  The City™s ARC is determined using an asset smoothing </br>methodology which </br>dampen</br>s </br>the volatility </br>of the market</br> value of</br> asset</br>s which</br> occurs </br>from</br> fluctuations in market conditions. The ARC payment for fiscal year 2011 has </br>not </br>been </br>det</br>ermined by the SDCERS actuary</br> as of the issuance of this report; however  it has been </br>estimated </br>by the SDCERS actuary  presented to the Board on July 17  2009 and September </br>18  2009  </br>to be</br> approximately $224 million</br>.  This is an increase of $</br>70 million</br>  </br>or 45%  </br>over the ARC payment of $15</br>4 million</br> the City is obligated to fund in fiscal year 2010.  </br>Any </br>significant increase in the fiscal year 2011 ARC payment will require the City to reduce </br></br>operating expenses which will affect services and programs. </br></br> </br>In fiscal year 2008  </br>Governmental Accounting </br>Standards Board Statement </br>45  ﬁGASB 45ﬂ  went into </br>effect requiring all municipal </br>ActuarialActuarial</br>Funded</br>Valuation Date</br>Value of Assets</br>UAAL</br>Ratio</br>6 30 2005</br>2 983 080</br>$        1 452 937</br>$        67.3%</br>6 30 2006</br>3 981 932</br>          1 000 768</br>          79.9%</br>6 30 2007</br>4 413 411</br>          1 184 242</br>          78.8%</br>6 30 2008</br>4 660 346</br>          1 303 204</br>          78.2%</br>Pension Funding Progress </br> Thousands </br>ActuarialActuarial</br>Funded</br>Valuation Date</br>Value of Assets</br>UAALRatio</br>6 30 2008</br>29 637</br>$             1 206 070</br>$        2.4%</br>6 30 2009</br>41 497</br>              1 317 880</br>          3.1%</br>Retiree Healthcare Liabilities </br> Thousands </br>General </br>Government</br>12%Police</br>17%Fire &amp; Life </br>Safety</br>9%Parks &amp; </br>Recreation</br>11%Transportation</br>10%Sewer Utility</br>13%Water Utility</br>14%LT Debt </br>Interest</br>3%All Other</br>11%Total Government</br> Wide Expenses</br>17CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>governments to report on Other Post Employment Benefits  retiree healthcare costs  in a </br>manner similar to reporting on pension benefits.  The City™s actuarial valuation for retiree </br>healthcare costs estimated an unfunded actuarial accrued liability </br> UAAL  </br>of $1.</br>318</br> billion </br>as of June 30  2009. The City is participating in a </br>trust administered by CalPERS to fund this </br>long</br> term liability and  to date  has contributed $54 million to the CalPERS trust.  The fair </br>value of these assets as of June 30  2009 was $</br>41.5 </br>million.  The City is not currently fully </br>funding the ARC for retir</br>ee healthcare</br>  </br>which is $1</br>20.3 </br>million for fiscal year 201</br>1.  The </br>amount budgeted for fiscal year 2010 is $57.1 million  of which $32.1 million will fund the </br>pay </br>go portion and $25 million</br> is expected to be</br> transferred to the CalPERS trust</br> by fiscal </br>year e</br>nd. </br> </br>Governmental Funds  Tax Supported Operations </br>   The City™s General Fund finished fiscal year 2009 with unrestricted cash and</br> investments of </br>approximately $87</br> million.  As a fiscal precaution against natural disasters or unforeseen </br>events  the City maintains an emergency reserve fund that can only be accessed for </br>qualifying emergencies as declared by the Mayor and or City Council and approved by at </br>least a 2 3 </br>vote of the City Council.  The General Fund Reserve Policy set a funding goal of </br>7.0% of General Fund revenue by the end of fiscal year 2009. The General Fund reserve </br>was actually 7.</br>7% of General Fund revenue at June 30  2009  resulting in a total reserve </br>balance of $7</br>8.3 </br>million.  This balance is reported within the General Fund Balance Sheet as </br>Undesignated Fund Balance.  The reserves are currently cash funded within the City </br></br>Treasury™s pooled cash portfolio. The goal is to establish General Fund reserves</br> at 8% of </br>revenues by fiscal year 2012.</br>  </br>The </br>Fiscal year</br> 2010 Budget adopted in June 2009 reflected a reduction of expense growth </br>by reducing program expenditures and imposing an across the board 6%</br> reduction in</br> compensation </br>for</br> all City employees.  The City also was successful in redesigning the </br>pension benefit package for </br>most</br> employees</br> hired after July 1  2009.  </br>Due to a projected </br>decline in the City™s major revenues  management addressed the City™s projected budgetary </br></br>imbalance by proposing  and City Co</br>uncil then adopting  a </br>Fiscal year</br> 2010 Budget that </br>reduced spending on current services while also attempting to mitigate service level </br></br>reductions.  Council adopted a Fiscal year</br> 2010 Budget in June 2009 that balanced </br>estimated revenues to expenditures. </br>  During fiscal year 2009  total </br>long</br> term </br>liabilities of the City™s governmental activities </br>increased by $1</br>98 million.  This was primarily the result </br>of the </br>capital improvement</br> 2009A </br>lease revenue bond issue for $103 million for various capital improvement</br> projects and an </br>increase to the Net Other</br> Postemployment Benefits Obligation of $45 million.  Overall  our </br>annual interest costs for governmental activities were approximately $8</br>4 </br>million in fiscal </br>year 2009  which represents approximately 5% of our total</br> governmental activities </br>expenses</br>. </br> The City™s capital assets are essential to providing services to its residents and maintaining </br></br>the quality of its environment. During fiscal year 2009  total capital assets for governmen</br>tal </br>activities increased by $120</br> m</br>illion.  This was funded by a combination of developer </br>contributions  grant monies  and city </br>funded capital improvement programs.</br>  </br>The City™s </br>capital improvement</br> backlog is estimated to be approximately $800 to $900 </br>million according to the most recent Five Year Financial Outlook.  This</br> amount</br> is the most </br>recent estimate and</br> includes the cost of needed repairs to City facilities  streets and storm </br>drains but does not include </br>alleys  sidewalks </br>or soft costs</br>.  </br>The City is in the process of </br>18CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>assessing and updating its cost estimate for its capital improvement backlog.  </br>These costs </br>have been deferred because the City has not had the necessary funding resources.  </br>As mentioned above </br> the City issued $103 million in bonds </br>to fund deferred projects</br> during </br>fiscal year 2009</br>.  The bond proceeds will be used to </br>fund deferred</br> capital improvement</br> projects within the City. </br> The City™s Public Liability Fund  </br>which accounts for governmental </br>fund </br>related claims  has a </br>deficit </br>of approximately $4</br>9 </br>million as of </br>June 30  2009.</br>  This deficit </br>includes an accrued liability for </br></br>actuarially calculated claims costs  </br>incurred but not reported claims</br>  </br>and allocated and unallocated </br>loss</br>es </br>of approximately $5</br>9 </br>million</br>  </br>offset with the cash </br>reserves collected in the fund</br>.  This fund has seen significantly </br>higher claims since fiscal year </br>2005  largely as a result of the </br>legal claims and investigations </br></br>stemming from the pension fund </br></br>underpayment and related financial disclosure issues</br>; however</br>  </br>most of these unusual costs </br>were paid through</br> fiscal year 2007</br> and fiscal year 2008</br>.  The Workers™ Compensation Fund  </br>which accounts for both governmental and business</br> type claims  has a deficit of $114 </br>million as of June 3</br>0  2009. </br>This deficit includes an accrued liability for actuarially calculated </br>liabilities for open and unreported claims</br>  </br>as well as a provision for the allocated loss </br>adjustment expense totaling approximately $148 million</br>  </br>offset with the cash reserves </br>collected in the fund</br>.  The t</br>otal liability for workers compensation has decline</br>d </br>since fiscal </br>year 2007</br> due to a downward trend in the number of claims and the effect of State </br>legislation </br>regarding</br> workers compensation reform enacted in 2004.  </br>Per the City</br> Reserve </br>Policy  the City has budgeted funds annually to establish cash reserves</br> to reach the goal </br>of 50% of the </br>estimated outstanding liabilities</br> in each fund.  While the City is committed to </br>funding reserves in the Worker™s Compensation and Public Liabil</br>ity funds  </br>and has included </br>funding for these reserves in the fiscal year 2010 budget  the goal of funding 50% of </br></br>outstanding </br>liabilities</br> in both funds by 2014 is being reassessed given the economic </br>downturn and continued decline in General Fund revenues.</br>   </br></br></br>20052006200720082009</br></br>City of San Diego</br>Total Public Liability Claims Cash Payments</br>19CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Governmental Activities Key Indicators</br>            20 40 </br>60 80 100 120 20052006</br>20072008</br>2009Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>General Fund Cash and Investments</br>1 600 </br>1 700 </br>1 800 </br></br>1 900 </br>2 000 </br>2 100 </br></br>2 200 </br>20052006200720082009Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>Total Governmental Activities Long Term Liabilities</br>4 150 </br>4 200 </br>4 250 </br></br>4 300 </br>4 350 </br>4 400 </br></br>4 450 </br>20052006200720082009Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>Total Governmental Activities Capital Assets</br> 300 </br> 100 </br>100 300 20052006200720082009</br>Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>Governmental Activites Unrestricted Net Assets</br> General Fund Cash </br>  Continued</br> expenditure savings </br>due </br>to vacancies and management </br>imposed reductions in discretionary </br>spending have helped the City to </br>maintain a relatively stable cash </br>position.</br> Total </br>Long Term </br>Liabilities</br>  The City issued $103 million in </br>Lease Revenue Bonds to finance </br>various public improvements during </br>FY 2009. The City™s obligation </br>related to Other Post</br> employment </br>Benefits also increased $45 million </br>in FY 2009  together creating an </br>increase in total</br> long term</br> liabilities </br>of approximately </br>10.1</br>%.  Capital Assets</br>  Capital Assets increase</br>d </br>by approximately $</br>120</br> million during </br>FY 2009.

Unrestricted Net Assets</br>  Unrestricted Net Assets increased</br> approximately $</br>92 million in FY </br>2009.  This was primarily the result </br>of Redevelopment Agency revenues </br>exceeding expenses to fund multi</br> year capital improvements.</br>  20CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Business Type </br>Activities</br>   The majority of the City™s business</br> type activities are related to utilities that provide water </br>and wastewater services.  The Water and Metropolitan Wastewater Departments have been </br>consolidated into a single Public Utilities Department and </br>continue to</br> serve several regional </br>agencies outside of the City™s boundaries.  The utilities operations are mainly supported by </br>fees charged to customers.  The Independent Rate Oversight Committee  an independent </br>committee of stakeholders  monitors utility</br> rates and expenditures on behalf of the </br>ratepayers. </br></br> The City™s Water Utility Fund issued $</br>485</br> million of Water Revenue </br>and Revenue </br>Refunding </br>Bonds  Series 2009A</br> and 2009B during fiscal year 2009</br> to pre</br>pay outstanding principal of </br>$207 million of Subordin</br>ated Water Revenue Notes  Series 2007A</br> and 2008B; refund $94 </br>million of Certificates of Undivided Interest  Series 1998</br> monies; and to finance capital </br>improvements on the water system.</br> The publicly offered Water 2009A</br> and 2009B</br> Revenue </br>Refunding Bonds are </br>secured by and payable solely from net system revenues of the Water </br>Utility Fund.  </br>The City™s Wastewater Utility Fund issued $1.089 billion of Senior Sewer </br>Revenue Bonds to finance capital improvements to the wastewater system; fully refund </br>$22</br>4 </br>million in</br> wastewater revenue notes; and to refund approximately $6</br>83 million in </br>wastewater revenue bonds.  The net change in these notes and bonds payable during fiscal </br>year 2009 is the primary reason the business</br> type long term liabilities increased $344 </br>million o</br>ver fiscal year 2008. </br> For the year ended June 30  2009  the City™s business</br> type activities closed with restricted </br>and unrestricted cash and investment balances totaling $</br>1.2 billion</br>  an increase over fiscal </br>year 2008 of approximately $31</br>9 </br>million as a re</br>sult of the debt issues discussed above</br>.   </br>While the City™s capital assets for business</br> type activities have continued to increase in </br>value  deferred maintenance remains an ongoing challenge.  The City maintains a network </br></br>of </br>over 3</br> 000 miles of water pipes</br> and </br>over 3</br> 0</br>00 miles of sewer and waste water lines.</br>  Compliance with environmental regulations generally requires infrastructure construction  </br>including the replacement of water distribution systems </br> treatment plant upgrades  </br>the </br>replacement of wastewate</br>r collection systems  and improving sewage treatment capacity. </br>The City has agreed</br> with various state and federal regulators to build</br> significant </br>infrastructure upgrades.  In </br>June </br>2009  the City received</br> tentative approval of </br>a third five</br> year waiver permit from the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  and the state Regional </br>Water Quality Control Board </br>to continue operat</br>ing</br> the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment </br>Plant </br>at advanced primary treatment level</br>.  The City is still working with the California </br>Coastal </br>Commission to receive final wording on a consistency determination in support of </br>this EPA decision.  The resolution is anticipated in early 2010.</br>  The City is also facing challenges to the future of its water supplies. A persistent regional </br>drought and jud</br>icial decisions regarding management of the State Water Project has put </br>significant pressure on San Diego™s regional water supplies. The City of San Diego imports </br></br>as much as 90% of its water supply. Th</br>e reliability of th</br>at supply </br>has been</br> reduced </br>because </br>of court decisions  </br>weather conditions  </br>the diminishing availability of stored water  and </br>dwindling supplies of new water.  The City continues to work with its water wholesalers  the </br></br>San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of So</br>uthern </br>California  to </br>address </br>these supply issues but currently operates under a mandatory water </br>conservation target to achieve an 8% reduction in overall use.  The City™s performance from </br></br>June through September has averaged a monthly reduction of over 12%</br>. </br>The availability of </br>21CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>water has legal implications and could potentially affect City Council</br> findings regarding state </br>mandated water supply assessments for future development. These assessments must </br>demonstrate the long</br> term availability of water for large</br> projects before those projects can </br>be approved by local jurisdictions.  At this time  it is unclear what effect limitations to water </br>supplies would have on the City™s economy and its revenues</br> as the most recent project </br>assessments have all been able to fi</br>nd potable water offsets through the increased use of </br>reclaimed water</br>.  </br>The Mayor also proposed and the City Council approved in October 2009 a </br>revised Landscape Ordinance in advance of the state™s requirement to do so by January </br></br>2010.  The City is also moving forward with the California Department of Public Health to </br></br>undertake a demonstration project intended to verify that highly treated municipal </br>wastewater can be placed in a drinking water reservoir. </br> </br>Best Practice Operating Improvements</br>  The City took</br> a major leap forward on July 1  2009 when it went live with its new SAP </br>Enterprise Resource Planning  </br>ERP</br>  </br>financial system.  After two years of planning  the City </br>successfully began the transition to a</br>n </br>integrated financial system which allowed us to </br>eli</br>minate over a dozen legacy software applications.  Throughout fiscal year</br> 2010  core </br>functionality modules will be implemented  eliminating even more costly legacy software </br>applications and hardware.  The addition of </br>the ERP</br> system </br>and a well trained workforce </br>are </br>expected to</br> significantly improve the City™s financial operations and reporting capabilities.</br>  Internal controls over financial operations and reporting continue to be a focus issue for the </br>City.  As part of the </br>ERP</br> system  </br>the City has invested in an integrated internal controls </br>module called Governance  Risk and Compliance  GRC .  GRC  coupled with new process </br>and procedure documents </br> are expected</br> to improve our internal control environment. </br>In </br>addition  the City has established a comprehensive plan and has the proper staffing in place </br></br>to complete the remediation of </br>weaknesses in </br>internal controls over financial reporting </br>within 14 months.  </br> The Five Year Financial Outlook</br>  In October 2009  the City released an updated Five</br> Year Financial Outlook  the Outlook  for </br>fiscal year</br>s 2011 through 2015.  This document is an examination of the City™s long range </br>fiscal condition and financial challenges.  The City update</br>s </br>the Outlook p</br>eriodically to </br>account for changed circumstances. </br> </br>The City™s General Fund was the primary focus of the 2011</br> 2015 Outlook.  Approximately </br>68% of the City™s major revenues consist of four revenue sources: property tax  sales tax  </br></br>TOT</br>  and franchise fees.  Nearly 70% of the City™s General Fund expenditures are personnel </br>expenses.  Negative economic factors have resulted in a downward revision to revenue </br></br>projections for the </br>fiscal year</br> 2010 annual budget  which served as a base for the </br>Outlook.  </br>The Outlook discussed risks and opportunities that affect fiscal decisions and the City™s </br></br>ability to accomplish its strategic financial goals over the next five</br> year period.

Within </br>the City  this will mean a workforce reduction combined with </br>expenditure savings </br>from </br>reduced or eliminated p</br>rograms and services</br>.  The Mayor™s budget plan for fiscal year 2011 </br>does not include contributions to fund reserves; however  the plan proposes that reserves </br>will not be spent and will be maintained at current levels. </br> Looking Forward</br>  These are difficult economic times  and the City has set challenging goals for its future.  The </br>City believes these goals are achievable with continued fiscal discipline and greater </br>government efficiency.  </br>In some revenue categories  San Diego has relative</br>ly low taxes and </br>fees compared to most other large municipalities in the United States.  </br>San Diego enjoys an </br>ideal location with agreeable weather year round.  The diversity of industry  education and </br>tourism well positions the City for an early economic rebound when the economy begins its </br>eventual recovery.</br>  Out of these challenging times  San Diego is restructuring its operations  services and </br>programs so that the City will emerge with a sound  fundamentally sustainable municipal </br>business model.  We have </br>addressed the issues that have created prior difficulties for this </br>City  and we are structuring ourselves for long</br> term solvency and flexibility.  We will </br>continue to live within our means and balance our annual budgets. </br></br>   23CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Purpose  Background</br>  and Scope of this Report</br>   San Diego City Charter § 111 requires the City to submit an annual report  including a </br></br>Statement of Net Assets  and requires that all accounts of the City be audited by an </br></br>independent auditor.  Pursuant to this requirement  the </br>Comprehensive Annual Financial </br>Report  ﬁCAFRﬂ  of the City of San Diego  ﬁCityﬂ  for the fiscal year ended June 30  200</br>9  is </br>hereby submitted.  The audit firm of Macias Gini &amp; O™Connell LLP has issued an unqualified </br></br>opinion on the City of San Diego™s finan</br>cial statements.  The independent auditor™s report is </br>located at the front of the financial section of this report.  </br> The CAFR has been prepared in conformance with the principles and standards for reporting </br></br>as set forth by the Governmental Accounting Stan</br>dards Board  GASB .  Responsibility for </br>both the accuracy of the data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation  </br></br>including all disclosures  rests with the management of the City and its related agencies.  </br>The City™s</br> objective is to provide you with reasonable  rather than absolute  assurance that </br>the financial statements are free of any material misstatements.  Additionally  the City </br>continues to construct and improve a comprehensive internal control framework in order to </br>ensure acceptable manag</br>ement of taxpayer funds.</br>  To the best of our knowledge and belief  the data as presented  is accurate in all material </br>respects; it is presented in a manner designed to present fairly the financial position and </br></br>results of operations of the governmental acti</br>vities  business</br> type activities  the aggregate </br>discretely presented component units  each major fund  and the aggregate remaining funds </br>of the City and its related agencies; and all disclosures necessary to enable the reader to </br>gain an understanding of th</br>e City s  as well as its related agencies™  financial activities have </br>been included. </br> </br> A narrative introduction  overview  and analysis of the financial statements can be found in </br>Management™s Discussion and Analysis  MD&amp;A </br>  </br>which immediately follows the i</br>ndependent </br>auditor™s report.  The MD&amp;A complements this letter of transmittal and should be read in </br>conjunction with it. The CAFR is organized into three sections: </br>  The introductory section includes information about the organizational structure of the </br></br>Cit</br>y  the City™s economy  and selected other financial information.</br>   The financial section is prepared in accordance with </br>governmental a</br>ccounting </br>standards.

The City </br>comprises </br>342</br> square miles and  </br>as of January 1  200</br>9  the California Department of Finance estimates the population to be </br>1 353</br> 993</br>.  The City  with approximately </br>10 8</br>00 employees  provides a full range of </br>governmental services </br>including</br> police and fire protection  sanitation and health services  </br>the construction and maintenance of streets and infrastructure  recreational activities and </br></br>cultural events  and the maintenance and operation of the water and sewer utilities.</br>  Governing Structure</br> The City operates </br>under </br>and is governed by </br>the laws of the State of California and its own </br></br>Charter  </br>as periodically amended since its </br>adoption</br> by the electorate in 1931.  The City </br>is currently operating under a </br>Strong</br> M</br>ayor </br>form of government.  The departure</br>  on an </br>interim trial basis </br> from the City™s previous </br>Council </br>Manager form of government was </br>approved by a vote of the public and became </br></br>effective January 1  2006.  The Mayor is </br>elected at large to serve a four </br>year t</br>erm.  </br>  </br> Under the </br>Strong</br> M</br>ayor form of government  the Mayor is </br>the Chief Executive Officer of the City and has direct </br></br>oversight over all City functions and services except for the </br></br>City Council  Personnel  Ci</br>ty Clerk </br> Independent Budget </br>Analyst  IBA   City Attorney  and City Auditor </br>departments.  Under this form of government  the </br>City </br>Council is composed of eight members and is presided over </br>by the Council President  who is selected by a majority </br>vote of the </br>City </br>Council.  The Mayor presides over </br>City </br>Council in closed session meetings of the Council.  The </br></br>Council retains its legislative authority; however  all </br>City </br>Council resolutions</br> and ordinances</br> are subject to a veto of </br>the Mayor</br> except for certain ordina</br>nces including </br>emergency declarations and the City™s annual Salary and </br>Appropriations Ordinances</br>.  The City Council may override </br>a Mayoral veto with five votes.  The City Attorney  who is </br>elected for a four</br> year term  serves as the chief legal </br>advisor of a</br>nd attorney for the City and all departments.   </br> </br>During the County™s primary election held on June 3  2008  </br>voters approved Proposition B which requires </br>City </br>Council </br>to place a measure on the June 2010 ballot to allow voters </br>to decide whether the </br>Strong</br> M</br>ayor form of government </br>should become permanent effective January 1  2011.  Additionally  Proposition B provides </br>for the public to decide whether the number of </br>City </br>Council districts should increase from </br>eight to nine  and therefore  a corresponding increa</br>se of </br>City </br>Council votes required to </br>override the Mayor™s veto from five to six.  </br>Additionally  voters approved Proposition C</br>  </br>which separated the City Auditor™s Office from the Comptroller™s Office and made the Office </br></br>of the IBA permanent.  Under this ame</br>ndment  the City Auditor serves a </br>ten</br> year term and </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>20052006</br>200720082009</br></br>City of San Diego</br>Full Time and Part Time Employees</br>25CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>is supervised by an Audit Committee consisting of two Councilmembers and three members </br>of the public</br> with auditing expertise</br>  </br>who are appointed by the City Council</br>.

These financial statements are the respons</br>ibility of the City™s management. Our responsibility </br>is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit.  We di</br>d not audit the financial statements of the San Diego Housing Commissi</br>on  a discretely presented component unit  which </br>statements reflect 90%  95% and 85% of the total assets  total net assets and total revenues  respectively  </br></br>of the aggregate discretely presented component unit </br>totals.  Also  we did not audit the Southeastern </br>Economic Development Corporation  a blended component unit  which statements reflect less than 1% in </br>each of the total assets  total net assets and total revenues categories  respectively  of the aggregate </br></br>remaining fund information.  Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports </br></br>thereon has been furnished to us  and our opinion  insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the San </br>Diego Housing Commission and the Southeastern Economic Development Corporation is based solely on </br>the reports of the other auditors. </br>We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing </br>standards generally accepted in the United States of </br>America and the standards applicable </br>to financial audits contained in </br>Government Auditing Standards</br> issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.</br>  Those standards require that we plan and perform </br>the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whethe</br>r the financial statements are free of material </br>misstatement.  An audit includes consideration of in</br>ternal control over financial reporting as a basis for </br>designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances  but not for the purpose of expressing </br>an opinion on the effectiveness of the City™s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly  we </br></br>express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining  on a test basis  evidence supporting the </br>amounts and disclosures in the financial statements  assessing the accounting principles used and </br>significant estimates made by management  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement </br></br>presentation. We believe that our audit and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for </br></br>our opinions.   </br>In our opinion  based on our audit and the reports of other auditors  the financial statements referred to </br>above present fairly  in all material respects  the </br>respective financial position of the governmental </br>activities  the business type activities  the aggregate discretely presented component units  each major </br>fund  and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City as of June 30  2009  and the respective </br></br>changes in financial position and  where applicable  cash flows thereof for the year then ended in </br>conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </br>34As discussed in Note 1 to the basic financial statements  the City adopted the provisions of Governmental </br>Accounting Standards Board  GASB  Statement No. 49  </br>Accounting and Financial Reporting for </br>Pollution Remediation Obligations  effective July 1  2008.   </br>In accordance with Government Auditing Standards</br>  we have also issued our report dated </br>December 21  2009  on our consideration of the City™s internal control over financial reporting and on our </br>tests of its compliance with certain provisions of la</br>ws  regulations  contracts  and grant agreements and </br>other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testi</br>ng of internal control over </br>financial reporting and compliance and the results of th</br>at testing  and not to provide an opinion on the </br>internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit </br></br>performed in accordance with </br>Government Auditing Standards</br> and should be considered in assessing the </br>results of our audit. </br>The management™s discussion and analysis  schedules of funding progress and schedule of contributions </br>from employer and other contributing entities  and general fund budgetary information on pages 35 </br>through 48  168  and 172 through 174  respectively </br> are not a required part of the basic financial </br>statements but are supplementary information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the </br></br>United States of America. We have applied certain limited procedures  which consisted principally of </br></br>inquiries of management regarding the methods of measurement and presentation of the required </br>supplementary information. However  we did not audit the information and express no opinion on it.   </br>Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively </br>comprise the City™s basic financial statements.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</br> This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City™s basic financial statements.  The City™s ba</br>sic </br>financial statements are comprised of three compone</br>nts:  1  government</br> wide financial statements;  2  fund financial </br>statements; and  3  notes to the financial statements.  This report also contains other supplementary information in addition</br> to the basic financial statements. </br>GOVERNMENT</br> W</br>IDE </br>FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS</br>  The </br>focus of the </br>government </br>wide financial statements is on reporting on the operating results and financial position of the </br>government as an economic entity.  These statements are intended to report the entity™s operational accountability to its </br>readers  </br>giving information about the probable medium and long </br>term effects of past decisions on the government™s financial position</br>. </br>The statement of net assets presents information on all of the City™s assets and liabilities  with the difference between </br>the two </br>reported as net assets.  Over time  increases or decreases in net assets may serve as a useful indicator of whether the finan</br>cial </br>position of the City is improving or deteriorating. </br>The statement of activities presents information showing changes i</br>n the City™s net assets during the fiscal year </br>2009.  All </br>changes in net assets are reported when the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs  regardless of the timing of </br>related cash flows.  The focus is on both gross and net cost</br>s of City funct</br>ions  which are supported by general revenues.  This </br>Statement also distinguishes functions of the City that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues </br> governmental activities  from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user </br>fees and charges  business</br> type activities .  The governmental activities of the City include: General Government and Support; </br>Public Safety </br>  </br>Police; Public Safety </br>  </br>Fire and Life Safety</br> and Homeland Sec</br>urity</br>; Parks  Recreation  Culture and Leisure; </br>Transportation; Sanitation and Health; and Neighborhood Services.  The business</br> type activities of the City include:  Airports; </br>City Store; Development Services; Environmental Services; Golf Course; Recycling; Sewer Utility; and Water Utility. </br>The government</br> wide financial statements include the City  known as the</br>primary government  and the following legally </br>separate  discretely presented component units:  San Diego Convention Center Corporation  SDCCC ; and San Diego Housing </br>Commission  SDHC .  Financial information for these component units is reported separately from the financial information </br></br>presented for the primary government.

The City  like other state and local governments  uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate </br>compliance w</br>ith finance</br> related legal requirements.  All funds of the City can be divided into three categories: governmental </br>funds  proprietary funds  and fiduciary funds.</br> GOVERNMENTAL </br>FUNDS</br> Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions re</br>ported as governmental activities in the </br>government </br>wide financial statements.  However  unlike the government</br> wide financial statements  governmental fund financial </br>statements focus on near</br> term inflows</br>and outflows of spendable resources</br> as well as bala</br>nces of spendable resources </br>available at the end of the fiscal year.  Such information may be useful in evaluating a government™s near</br> term financing </br>requirements. </br>Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government</br> wide financi</br>al statements  it is useful to </br>compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in th</br>e government </br>wide financial statements.  By doing so  readers may better understand the long</br> term im</br>pact of the government™s </br>near term financing decisions.  Both</br> of the Governmental F</br>unds Balance S</br>heet and the </br>Governmental F</br>unds S</br>tatement of </br>Revenues  E</br>xpenditures  and </br>Changes in </br>Fund Balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison betwee</br>n governmental funds and governmental activities</br></br>The City maintains individual governmental funds.  Information is presented separately in the governmental funds balance shee</br>t and in the governmental funds statement of revenues  expenditures  and changes </br>in fund balances for the </br>General F</br>und  which </br>is a major fund.  Data from the other governmental funds are combined into a single  aggregated presentation.  Individual fun</br>d data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the </br>Supplementary Information section of this report. </br>The City adopts an annual appropriated budget for its </br>General F</br>und.  A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for </br>the General F</br>und to demonstrate compliance with this budget</br> and is presented as required supplementary information. </br>The basic governmental funds financial statements can be found beginning on </br>page 56 of this report.</br> PROPRIETARY </br>FUNDS</br> The City maintains two different types of proprietary funds  enterprise funds and internal service funds.  Enterprise </br>funds are </br>used to report the same functions presented as business</br> type</br>activities in the government</br> wide financial statements.  </br>The City </br>uses Enterprise Funds to</br> account for its various business</br> type activities  such as Sewer and Water Utilities.  Internal</br> Service </br>funds  such as </br>Fleet Services</br>  Central Stores  P</br>ublishing Services</br>  and Self Insurance  are used to report activities that provide </br>centralized supplies and</br> or services to the City.  All internal service funds  except for the </br>Special Engineering Fu</br>nd  have been </br>included within governmental activities in the government</br> wide financial statements since they predomina</br>ntly benefit </br>governmental functions.  The Special Engineering Fund  which services exclusively Sewer </br>and Water </br>activities  has been </br>included within business type activities in the government wide financial statements. </br></br>  37CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Proprietary fund statements provide the same type of information as the government</br> wide financial statements  only in more </br>detail.  The proprietary fund</br>s financial statements</br> provide separate information for the Sewer </br>and Water </br>funds  which are </br>considered to be major funds of the City.  Data for the nonmajor</br> proprietary funds are combined into a single  aggregated </br>presentation</br>  and the internal service funds are combined into </br>a single  aggregated presentation as well.  Included in the </br>Supplementary Information section of this report are</br> i</br>ndividual fund data for the </br>nonmajor proprietary funds and the </br>internal </br>service funds.</br>  The basic proprietary funds financial statements can b</br>e found beginning on page </br>60 of this report. </br>FIDUCIARY </br>FUNDS</br> Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government.  Fiduciary funds ar</br>e not </br>reflected in the government</br> wide financial statement</br>s because the resources of those funds are not available to support the </br>City™s </br>operations.  The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. </br>The basic fiduciary funds financial statements can be found beginning on page 63 of this report. </br>NOTES TO THE </br>FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS</br> The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government</br> wide and </br>fund financial statements.  The notes to the financial statements can be found beginning on page 65 of this report. </br>OTHER </br>INFORMATION</br> In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes  this report also presents certain required supplementar</br>y information concerning the City™s progress in funding its obligation to provide</br> pension and postemployment healthcare benefits to </br>its employees</br>  and the General Fund™s budgetary comparison schedule</br>.  Required supplementary information can be found </br>beginning on page </br>170 of this report. </br>The </br>individual fund data</br> referred to earlier in c</br>onnection with nonmajor governmental funds  nonmajor </br>proprietary </br>funds  internal </br>service funds  and fiduciary funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information on pensions</br> and </br>the General Fund budgetary comparison s</br>chedule</br>  beginning on </br>page 199 of this report. </br>   </br>        </br>  38CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>GOVERNMENT WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS </br> CITY OF SAN DIEGO S SUMMARY OF NET ASSETS</br> In Thousands </br>200920082009200820092008Capital Assets</br>4 455 525</br>$          4 335 317</br>$     4 766 721</br>$          4 634 918</br>$     9 222 246</br>$          8 970 235</br>$     Other Assets</br>2 110 185</br>            2 096 751</br>       1 357 070</br>            1 031 815</br>       3 467 255</br>            3 128 566</br>       Total Assets</br>6 565 710</br>            6 432 068</br>       6 123 791</br>            5 666 733</br>       12 689 501</br>          12 098 801</br>     Net Long Term Liabilities</br>2 164 276</br>            1 965 991</br>       2 413 033</br>            2 068 569</br>       4 577 309</br>            4 034 560</br>       Other Liabilities</br>143 231</br>               312 696</br>          110 479</br>               108 455</br>          253 710</br>               421 151</br>          Total Liabilities</br>2 307 507</br>            2 278 687</br>       2 523 512</br>            2 177 024</br>       4 831 019</br>            4 455 711</br>       Net Assets:</br>Invested in Capital Assets  </br>Net of Related Debt</br>3 530 937</br>            3 518 704</br>       2 970 351</br>            2 933 012</br>       6 501 288</br>            6 451 716</br>       Restricted</br>564 605</br>               564 042</br>          42 485</br>                 39 436</br>            607 090</br>               603 478</br>          Unrestricted</br>162 661</br>               70 635</br>            587 443</br>               517 261</br>          750 104</br>               587 896</br>          Total Net Assets</br>4 258 203</br>$          4 153 381</br>$     3 600 279</br>$          3 489 709</br>$     7 858 482</br>$          7 643 090</br>$     Governmental Activities</br>Business Type Activities</br>Total Primary Government</br>   As noted earlier  net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government™s financial position.  In the case of </br>the </br>City  assets exceeded liabilities by $</br>7 858 482 at June 30  </br>2009  an increase of $2</br>15 392 over fiscal year 2008. </br>$6 501 288  or approximately </br>82%  of total Net Assets represent the City™s investment in capital assets  e.g.  land  structures and </br>improvements  equipment  distribution and collections systems  infrastructure  and construction</br> in progress   less any </br>outstandi</br>ng debt used to acquire these assets.  The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently  </br>these assets are not available for future spending.  Although the City™s investment in capital assets is reported net of rela</br>ted </br>debt  it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources  since the capital </br>assets themselves generally are not used to liquidate these liabilities. </br>$6</br>07 090</br>  </br>or approximately </br>8%  of total Net Assets represent resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may </br>be used.</br>  The remaining balance of $</br>750 104</br>  or approximately </br>10%  is available to finance ongoing services and obligations to </br>the City™s citizens and creditors.</br>   Unrestricted </br>Net Assets increased by $</br>162 2</br>08  or approximately </br>28%.  Approximately $7</br>0 0</br>00 of this increase was in the </br>Business </br>Type activities  </br>primarily </br>attributed to</br> Council approved rate increases.  </br>Governmental ac</br>tivities increased by </br>approximately $</br>92 0</br>00.  </br>This was primarily</br> the result of </br>revenues exceeding expenses for </br>RDA </br>by approximately $70 000</br>.  RDA </br>projects are multi</br> year in nature</br>  </br>and therefore  </br>revenues collected on an annual basis are often budgeted for future larger </br>construction phases of the projects</br>.  In addition</br>  RDA experienced </br>increased property tax revenues</br> from fiscal year 2008 to </br>2009.

The current amount </br></br>in dispute is approximately $2 million. The capacity fees and revenues from the sale of the </br></br>reclaimed water are being held by the City pending resolution of this matter. See “—</br></br>Participating Agencies; Regional Wastewater Disposal Agreement; Transportation </br></br>Agreements.” </br> </br>The City has the right to make all decisions with respect to the planning  design  </br>construction  operation and maintenance of the Metropolitan Sub System. Decisions on issues </br></br>that impact the Participating Agencies are made with the advice of the Metropolitan </br></br>Commission. The Metropolitan Commission consists of one representative from each </br></br>Participating Agency and advocates for fair rates and other issues of importance to the </br></br>Participating Agencies. Although the Metropolitan Commission may make recommendations </br></br>to the City  the City retains ownership and decision making authority over all elements of the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System  including the capital improvements for the Metropolitan Sub </br></br>System.  </br>  26  </br>Metropolitan Sub System Facilities </br> General</br>. The current Metropolitan Sub System infrastructure  with the exception of the </br>South Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline  is located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the </br></br>City and is concentrated along a kidney shaped corridor running from Mission Bay to the </br></br>north  and along the perimeter of the San Diego Bay to the south. The map that follows the </br></br>Table of Contents of this Official Statement shows the geographic concentration of the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System’s infrastructure and identifies the major trunk lines that service the </br></br>Participating Agencies. The Metropolitan Sub System’s infrastructure currently consists of </br></br>three wastewater treatment plants  two ocean outfalls  a biosolids center  four pump stations </br></br>and force mains and gravity flow interceptors. The Metropolitan Sub System infrastructure </br></br>also includes two interceptors  which collect and route wastewater to the Point Loma Plant </br></br>from the Municipal Sub System and the Participating Agencies. The Wastewater System CIP </br></br>is dependent upon maintaining certain permits and waivers with respect to the Wastewater </br></br>System under Federal and State law. If existing permits and waivers are not maintained  the </br></br>City could incur costs in addition to those currently included in the City’s budgets and </br></br>projections. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Treatment of </br></br>Sewage.” The following is a summary description of the Metropolitan Sub System’s current </br></br>facilities and their respective primary functions. </br> </br>Point Loma Plant</br>. The Point Loma Plant began operation in 1963. The site is part of </br>the Fort Rosecrans military reservation and was acquired by the City from the U.S. </br></br>Department of the Interior  Bureau of Land Management. The Point Loma Plant is the </br></br>principal treatment facility in the Metropolitan Sub System  with a permitted treatment </br></br>capacity of 240 mgd flow with 432 mgd peak wet weather flow. During Fiscal Year 2009  the </br></br>Point Loma Plant had an average daily flow rate of 157.5 mgd  including return flows from </br></br>the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  North City Plant and South Bay Plant. The average daily </br></br>flow rate at the Point Loma Plant accounted for approximately 91.8% of the wastewater flow </br></br>generated within the Metropolitan Sub System. Almost all the inflow to the Point Loma Plant </br></br>is conveyed through the Metropolitan Sub System’s Pump Station No. 2  which is the terminus </br></br>for the North Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline and South Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline. </br></br>Flow from the North City Plant which is not distributed to reclaimed water users is returned to </br></br>the sewage conveyance system and is treated at the Point Loma Plant. In addition  the Point </br></br>Loma Plant serves as a standby facility for the North City Plant and the South Bay Plant in the </br></br>event one or both of these facilities is taken off line for maintenance purposes. </br> </br>The Point Loma Plant currently provides advanced primary treatment of sewage in </br>accordance with a waiver from the secondary treatment standards of the Clean Water Act  </br></br>which was originally received by the City in 1995  and renewed on September 13  2002 for the </br></br>period through June 2008. The City applied for an extension of the waiver and  in December </br></br>2008  the City received a tentative decision from the United States Environmental Protection </br></br>Agency  the “U.S. EPA”  that the Point Loma Plant and Point Loma Ocean Outfall  defined </br></br>herein  be granted a renewed waiver. This request is the City’s second renewal. During this </br></br>time  the present modified permit will be administratively continued. Pt Loma will continue to </br></br>operate under the provisions of the modified permit that was adopted in 2002  in full </br></br>compliance with the Clean Water Act section 301 h   as modified by the Ocean Pollution </br></br>Reduction Act.  </br> </br>The Point Loma Plant continues to operate under the current waiver through the </br>consideration and public comment process. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—Treatment of Sewage.” Treated wastewater from the Point Loma Plant is </br></br>discharged through the Point Loma Ocean Outfall  “Point Loma Outfall”   which was built in </br></br>1963. In 1993  the Point Loma Outfall was extended 2.0 miles from its original length  which </br></br>resulted in the present length of 4.5 miles. See “—Point Loma Ocean Outfall.” Ongoing capital </br> 27  </br>improvements to the Point Loma Plant are included in the Wastewater System CIP. See </br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.” </br> </br>Operations at the Point Loma Plant are monitored and controlled from a distributed  </br>computer based control system located in the Point Loma Plant’s control center. Local control </br></br>stations are also strategically located around the Point Loma Plant and can be used to access </br></br>the entire plant control system.  </br> </br>Presently  the Point Loma Plant is capable of removing 85% to 90% of total suspended </br>solids  “TSS” . The Point Loma Plant has increased its TSS removal rates through operational </br></br>improvements of its chemical treatment processes. The wastewater treatment process currently </br></br>employed at the Point Loma Plant consists of advanced primary treatment and a digester gas </br></br>utilization facility. Dewatering of sludge is provided at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center </br></br> described below . Methane gas produced during the digestion is fed to a City owned </br></br>cogeneration plant where it is converted to electricity and used to provide power to operate the </br></br>plant. Excess energy is sold back to the local electrical power grid. See “—Metropolitan </br></br>Biosolids Center.” </br> </br>North City Water Reclamation Plant</br>. The North City Water Reclamation Plant  the </br>“North City Plant”  is a sewage treatment facility that is capable of processing sewage to both </br></br>secondary and tertiary treatment levels. The North City Plant commenced operations in 1997 </br></br>and is located adjacent to Interstate 805 and Miramar Road in the northwestern quadrant of </br></br>the City. The North City Plant operates pursuant to a “Waste Discharge and Water Recycling </br></br>Requirements for the Production and Purveyance of Recycled Water ” Order No. 97 03  </br></br>Addendum No. 1  which was adopted by the California Regional Water Quality Board  the </br></br>“Regional Water Board”  on June 11  2003  the “North City Plant Permit” . The North City </br></br>Plant Permit  as amended  is effective until it is revoked or further modified. </br> </br>The North City Plant receives influent through the North City Tunnel Connector and </br>from the Penasquitos Pump Station. The North City Plant process includes screening  grit </br></br>removal  settling  flow equalization  activated sludge processing  tertiary filtration and effluent </br></br>disinfection. The Metropolitan Biosolids Center  described below  digests and dewaters the </br></br>sludge that is produced at the North City Plant. Support facilities of the North City Plant </br></br>include an administration building  operation and maintenance building and chemical </br></br>building. The North City Plant has a permitted capacity of 30 mgd average daily flow. Per the </br></br>requirements of a grant the City received from the EPA for construction of the North City </br></br>Plant  the City must treat flows equal to a minimum of 75% of the plant’s design capacity </br></br> i.e.  at least 22.5 mgd . For Fiscal Year 2009  the plant operated at an average flowrate of </br></br>approximately 22.7 mgd. The North City Plant is producing an average of 6.6 mgd of </br></br>reclaimed water that is distributed to users through the Northern Water Distribution System. </br></br>The North City Plant limits its production of reclaimed water to meet demand. Excess treated </br></br>effluent is returned to the sewer system for conveyance to the Point Loma Treatment Plant and </br></br>ocean outfall. Approximately 16.4 mgd is returned to the sewer system. See “—Point Loma </br></br>Plant.” The solids that are removed during the sewage treatment process  either by </br></br>sedimentation or biological oxidization  are pumped to the Metropolitan Biosolids Center for </br></br>further treatment. See “—Metropolitan Biosolids Center.”  </br> </br>The North City Plant currently produces reclaimed water that serves approximately </br>465 meters and two wholesale users that resell the reclaimed water for landscape irrigation. </br></br>Reclaimed water is also used for industrial processing  cooling towers  construction site dust </br></br>suppression and soil compaction  decorative fountains and toilet and urinal flushing. </br></br>Revenues from the sale of reclaimed water are collected by the Department for deposit in the </br></br>Water Utility Fund and used to pay for the cost of the reclaimed water distribution system </br></br>and then operations and maintenance costs for the distribution system. </br> 28  </br> In January 2004  the San Diego City Council authorized a comprehensive evaluation of </br>all viable options to maximize the usage of recycled water. In March 2006  the City of San </br></br>Diego  working in partnership with an Independent Advisory Panel and a City Assembly on </br></br>Water Reuse  published the “City of San Diego Water Reuse Study”  the “Water Reuse </br></br>Study” . The City’s Water Reuse Study included analysis and research on the health effects of </br></br>reuse options and a public participation process. The Reuse Study s stakeholders identified </br></br>Reservoir Augmentation at the City s San Vicente Reservoir as their preferred strategy. In </br></br>October 2007  the San Diego City Council also recognized the strategy as their preferred </br></br>alternative. </br> </br>Conducting a Water Reuse Study was the first phase of a three phased water reuse </br>program that includes the development of a Demonstration Project  phase two  that could </br></br>lead to implementation of a full scale Indirect Potable Reuse Reservoir Augmentation project </br></br> phase three . </br> </br>The City has initiated an Indirect Potable Reuse Reservoir Augmentation </br>Demonstration Project at North City to determine the feasibility of using advanced water </br></br>treatment on recycled wastewater for augmentation of supplies in a local reservoir. Reservoir </br></br>water would undergo further treatment before being distributed as drinking water; such </br></br>project is not expected to materially affect the Wastewater System in the near future. </br> </br>South Bay Water Reclamation Plant</br>. The South Bay Plant commenced operations in </br>2002. This plant  located on Dairy Mart Road north of the International Border with Tijuana  </br></br>Mexico  is a sewage treatment facility that is capable of processing sewage to both secondary </br></br>and tertiary treatment levels. The South Bay Plant operates under an NPDES permit for the </br></br>treatment and disposal of wastewater through the shared South Bay Ocean Outfall and </br></br>Reclaimed Water Permit No. 2000 203  the “Reclaimed Water Permit”   which authorizes </br></br>water reclamation from the South Bay Plant. The Reclaimed Water Permit  as previously </br></br>amended  is effective until it is revoked. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—General.” </br> </br>Untreated wastewater is pumped to the South Bay Plant’s headworks from the Otay </br>River Pump Station and the Grove Avenue Pump Station  which divert flow from the South </br></br>Metro Interceptor. The South Bay Plant has a permitted capacity of 15 mgd average daily </br></br>flow. For Fiscal Year 2009 the plant operated at an average flowrate of approximately 8.5 </br></br>mgd. The South Bay Plant produced an average of 4.7 mgd of reclaimed water that was </br></br>distributed to users. The South Bay Plant limits its production of reclaimed water to meet </br></br>demand. The South Bay Plant uses a phased tertiary process that allows the tertiary process to </br></br>be bypassed when reclaimed water is not being produced  which increases efficiency and </br></br>reduces plant operations and maintenance cost. Excess treated effluent is discharged to the </br></br>South Bay Ocean Outfall for disposal. See “South Bay Ocean Outfall.” The South Bay Plant </br></br>does not treat its own solids and cannot discharge its solids to the Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center directly. Primary sludge is pumped to the South Metropolitan Interceptor Pipeline and </br></br>conveyed to the Point Loma Plant for further treatment and from there to the Metropolitan </br></br>Biosolids Center for processing. See “—Point Loma Plant” and “—Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center.”  </br> </br>The City is seeking to increase use of reclaimed water generated by the South Bay Plant </br>and has entered into an agreement with the Otay Water District pursuant to which the Otay </br></br>Water District may purchase up to 6 mgd of reclaimed water for resale by the Otay Water </br></br>District for landscape irrigation. During Fiscal Year 2009  54% of the treated sewage was </br></br>beneficially reused by the Otay Water District  the International Wastewater Treatment Plant  </br></br>a federally owned and operated treatment facility in the Tijuana River Valley  or used for in </br> 29  </br>plant purposes. During warmer periods of the year  almost the entire amount of wastewater </br>treated at the South Bay Plant is reused. </br> </br>Operations at the South Bay Plant are monitored and controlled from a distributed  </br>computer based control system located in the South Bay Plant’s control center. Local control </br></br>stations are also strategically located around the South Bay Plant and can be used to access </br></br>the entire plant control system. </br> </br>Point Loma Ocean Outfall</br>. The Point Loma Ocean Outfall was constructed in 1963 to </br>provide a method for disposal of all Point Loma Plant effluent. The original capacity of the 2.5 </br></br>mile long  108 inch diameter outfall has been estimated at 390 mgd under the original design </br></br>configuration. The Point Loma Ocean Outfall Extension  a 2.0 mile extension of the original </br></br>outfall  was completed in 1993  resulting in a 4.5 mile long outfall discharging treated sewage </br></br>effluent at an approximate depth of 320 feet of water at the discharge point and a capacity of </br></br>432 mgd. The Point Loma Ocean Outfall uses a Y shaped diffuser to provide for a wide </br></br>dispersal of effluent into the ocean. It is one of the longest  deepest ocean outfalls in the United </br></br>States. The Department believes that the length  depth  design and location of the Point Loma </br></br>Ocean Outfall facilitates protection of ocean water beneficial uses. </br> </br>South Bay Ocean Outfall</br>. The South Bay Ocean Outfall discharges flows from the </br>City’s South Bay Plant and the International Boundary and Water Commission’s International </br></br>Treatment Plant. The South Bay Ocean Outfall consists of a land portion running 3.3 miles </br></br>and an ocean portion discharging 3.5 miles off the coast at a depth of 95 feet. The outfall is </br></br>jointly owned by the City and the International Boundary and Water Commission. The City </br></br>has a 40% ownership interest in the South Bay Ocean Outfall  or approximately 133 mgd of </br></br>the peak flow capacity of 333 mgd.  </br> </br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center</br>. The Metropolitan Biosolids Center commenced </br>operations in 1998 on a 39 acre site leased from the United States Navy within the Miramar </br></br>Marine Corps Air Station located off Highway 52 in the north central portion of the City. The </br></br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center is regulated under the Point Loma Plant’s Modified Permit </br></br> hereinafter defined  because all waste streams from the Metropolitan Biosolids Center are sent </br></br>to the Point Loma Plant for treatment. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—Treatment of Sewage.” The lease with the United States Navy  the “Prime </br></br>Lease”  expires in 2045. The United States Navy may terminate the Prime Lease during its </br></br>term without the \n",

In the event the Prime Lease is terminated </br></br>during its term by the United States Navy  the City would be obliged to vacate the site and </br></br>relocate this facility elsewhere.  </br> </br>The Metropolitan Biosolids Center discharges side streams  centrate  from the raw </br>sludge thickening and biosolids  digested sludge  dewatering centrifuges as well as effluent </br></br>from other internal processes to the Point Loma Plant. The Metropolitan Biosolids Center is an </br></br>essential part of the Modified Permit described under the caption “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Treatment of Sewage—Relief From Secondary Treatment </br></br>Requirements.” The facility consists of anaerobic digestors  storage tanks  screening and </br></br>degritting systems  polymer injection systems  eight dewatering centrifuges  five thickening </br></br>centrifuges  a state of the art odor control facility  chemical building  operations and </br></br>maintenance building  and a privately operated cogeneration facility serving the energy needs </br></br>of the Metropolitan Biosolids Center. The facility thickens and digests sludge from the North </br></br>City Plant that is received through the 5 mile North City Raw Sludge Pipeline. In addition  the </br></br>facility mechanically dewaters the North City Plant’s digested sludge as well as the sludge </br> 30  </br>that is digested at the Point Loma Plant. The digested sludge from the Point Loma Plant is </br>pumped to the Metropolitan Biosolids Center through the 17 mile Miramar Pipeline. </br> </br>Once sludge is thickened  digested and dewatered at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  </br>the Department disposes of biosolids through landfill disposal  direct land application  or </br></br>alternate daily cover.

              " Regulatory Requirements.” Due to the nature of operations at the </br></br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center  the facility employs extensive odor control facilities to treat the </br></br>foul air from the major treatment processes. </br> </br>The Metropolitan Biosolids Center and North City Plant have privatized cogeneration </br>plants which are owned and operated by Minnesota Methane San Diego  LLC  “MMSD”   a </br></br>subsidiary of Fortistar Methane Group  LLC. The City has subleased methane gas rights from </br></br>the adjacent landfill  the “Miramar Landfill”  and the Metropolitan Biosolids Center’s digester </br></br>gas to MMSD  the “Landfill Gas Lease”   which burns the fuel in its cogeneration plants to </br></br>produce electricity and heat. The City has purchase contracts  the “Cogeneration Facility </br></br>Agreements”  with MMSD to buy electricity for operations at the Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center and the North City Plant. The Cogeneration Facility Agreements are scheduled to expire </br></br>in June 2019. Any excess power that is generated is sold by MMSD to the power grid. This </br></br>arrangement allows the Wastewater System  including portions used by the Participating </br></br>Agencies  to decrease its dependence on external sources of power and reduces energy </br></br>expenditures. The Participating Agencies do not receive revenues with respect to the </br></br>Cogeneration Facility Agreements. Under the Landfill Gas Lease and the Cogeneration Facility </br></br>Agreements  the City bears the risk of a possible termination of the Prime Leases. The Prime </br></br>Leases allow the Federal government to terminate such lease in the event the City breaches the </br></br>terms thereof or  in some instances  without breach by the City. If the United States Navy </br></br>terminates the Prime Leases for its convenience  it will owe the City an equitable adjustment of </br></br>the City’s rent on the parcels on which the Miramar landfill and the Metropolitan Biosolids </br></br>Center stand. If the United States Navy terminates the Prime Leases for any reason  then the </br></br>City must purchase MMSD’s facilities  including the landfill gas collection system installed by </br></br>MMSD and the cogeneration plants at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center and the North City </br></br>Plant at a purchase price equal to the greater of a “stipulated purchase price”  provided by </br></br>formula in the contract  which takes into account such factors as initial and depreciated </br></br>values  or the “fair market value” of the facilities  as each of these terms is defined in the </br></br>agreements with MMSD. The maximum amount of exposure to the City for the loss of these </br></br>facilities is estimated to be </br>$38 million. Such a loss would only arise upon the occurrence of a </br>default by the City or termination by the United States Navy for its convenience. The City </br></br>believes that it is unlikely that the United States Navy will terminate the Prime Leases for any </br></br>reason other than an uncured breach by the City or in the event of a national or military </br></br>emergency in part because of the United States Navy’s reliance on the landfill and the City’s </br></br>substantial investments in placing regionally crucial wastewater infrastructure  such as the </br></br>Metropolitan Biosolids Center at Miramar. See “RISK FACTORS—Utility Costs.”  </br> </br>Pump Stations</br>. There are four pump stations that service the Metropolitan Sub </br>System. Two pump stations  Pump Station No. 1 and Pump Station No. 2  began operation in </br></br>1963. A third pump station  the Grove Avenue Pump Station  began operations in 2002 to </br></br>pump wastewater to the South Bay Plant. The Otay River Pump Station was added to the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System in 2003 to pump wastewater to the South Bay Plant.

              " Gorge Pump Station  Sewage Pump </br></br>Station No. 64  Sewage Pump Station No. 65 and Penasquitos Pump Station  which are part </br></br>of the Municipal Sub System.  </br> </br>Interceptors</br>. The Metropolitan Sub System interceptors consist of two major branches  </br>the South Branch and the North Branch  which meet at Pump Station No. 2. Interceptor </br> 31  </br>capacities are adequate for current peak flows and the City models capacity consistent with all </br>current regulations. Due to capacity limitations at Pump Station No. 2  the Department </br></br>initiated the Wet Weather Storage Facility Project which is expected to be needed by </br>2011 in </br>order to minimize the risk of sewage spills. The Wet Weather Storage Project will include the </br></br>construction of an underground storage tank with a capacity of seven million gallons near </br></br>Pump Station No. 2 to store excess wastewater flow during the peak wet weather flow period </br></br>to relieve the capacity constraint at Pump Station No. 2. An alternative to the Wet Weather </br></br>Storage Facility Project is the Wet Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project which the </br></br>Department is currently studying. The Wet Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project will </br></br>include a study of the feasibility of disposing the tertiary treated reclaimed water from the </br></br>North City Plant to the streams or canyons during the peak wet weather flow period to relieve </br></br>the capacity constraint at Pump Station No. 2. If Department deems that this project is </br></br>feasible  the Wet Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project will require the acquisition of </br></br>an NPDES permit from the Regional Water Board and the modification of existing reclaimed </br></br>water and sewer facilities. The Wet Weather Storage Project can be deferred to </br>2015 if the Wet </br>Weather Intermittent Stream Discharge Project is implemented. </br> Municipal Sub System Facilities </br> </br>The Municipal Sub System consists of approximately 3 000 miles of trunk and collector </br>mains  79 sewer pump stations  including East Mission Gorge Pump Station  Sewage Pump </br></br>Station No. 64  Sewage Pump Station No. 65  and Penasquitos Pump Station  serving </br></br>approximately 275 000 accounts with connections to the sanitary sewer system. </br></br>Approximately 83% of these connections are from accounts relating to single family dwellings  </br></br>11% are from accounts relating to multifamily dwellings and the remaining 6% are from </br></br>accounts relating to commercial and industrial customers  these percentages include multiple </br></br>accounts at some locations . On average  these accounts generate 109 mgd of wastewater </br></br>which is conveyed by the Municipal Sub System to the Metropolitan Sub System for treatment </br></br>and disposal. The Municipal Sub System also includes 54 permanent flow monitoring stations </br></br>which are utilized for multiple purposes  including strength based billing  facility planning  </br></br>sewer modeling  criticality evaluation  infiltration inflow analysis and spill detection.  </br> Additional Contractual Capacity to the Escondido Plant and the San Elijo Plant </br> </br>The Department does not connect the Rancho Bernardo sewer service area to pipelines </br>within the Municipal Sub System. Pursuant to a sewage disposal agreement with the City of </br></br>Escondido entered into in 1972  up to five mgd of sewage emanating from the Rancho </br></br>Bernardo sewer service area of the City may be treated at Escondido’s Hale Avenue Treatment </br></br>Plant  the “Escondido Plant” . The Escondido Plant is not owned by the City and is not part of </br></br>the Municipal Sub System. This agreement is scheduled to terminate in 2022  fifty years from </br></br>the date on which sewage flow commenced through the Escondido Plant  and may be </br></br>extended at the City’s option for an unlimited number of ten year periods. The Escondido </br></br>Plant  which can process up to 18 mgd of sewage  currently is treating approximately 3 mgd </br></br>of flow from the City. The City of Escondido is considering options to increase its treatment </br></br>capacity to accommodate expected population growth.  </br> </br>Pursuant to a sewage disposal agreement with the Solana Beach Sanitation District </br>entered into in 1974  as amended and supplemented in 1975  the City has the right to connect </br></br>to sewer lines within the Solana Beach Sanitation District. Pursuant to such agreement  the </br></br>City may permit the connection to the Solana Beach Sanitation District of up to 300 EDUs  or </br></br>84 000 gallons per day  of sewage emanating from the portion of the City contiguous to Del </br></br>Mar and Solana Beach may be treated at the San Elijo Water Reclamation Plant  the “San Elijo </br></br>Plant” . Sewage treated at the San Elijo Plant is disposed through the San Elijo Ocean Outfall  </br></br>which is owned by the City of Solana Beach and the Cardiff Sanitation District and operated </br> 32  </br>by the Solana Beach Sanitation District  the Cardiff Sanitation District and the City of </br>Escondido. The San Elijo Plant and the San Elijo Ocean Outfall are not owned by the City and </br></br>they are not part of the Municipal Sub System. This sewage disposal agreement terminates in </br></br>2025 and contains no provisions for extension or renewal. </br> Historical Wastewater System Flow </br> </br>Table 4 below sets forth total annual system flow through the Wastewater System </br> including the Point Loma Plant and the South Bay Plant  and through the City of Escondido </br></br>to the Escondido Plant and the City of Solana Beach to the San Elijo Plant  and total annual </br></br>reclaimed water flow through the North City Plant for Fiscal Years 2000 through 2009.  </br> TABLE 4 </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br>TOTAL ANNUAL FLOW </br> In Million Gallons </br> 1  Fiscal Year 2000 through Fiscal Year 2009 </br> Fiscal </br>Year </br>Ended </br>June 30 </br>City Flow </br>Through </br>Point </br>Loma </br>Plant </br>Participatin</br>g Agency </br>Flow </br>Through </br>Point Loma </br>Plant </br>City Flow </br>Through </br>Escondido </br>Plant</br> 2 </br> City Flow </br>Through </br>San Elijo </br>Plant</br> 2 </br> Reclaimed </br>Water </br>Through </br>North City </br>Plant </br>City Flow </br>Through </br>South Bay </br>Plant </br>Total </br>System </br>Flow </br>Average </br>MGD </br>For The </br>Year </br>2000 44 771 21 489 1 401 0 1 267 0 68 928 189 </br>2001 44 735 21 437 1 412 0 879 0 68 463 188 </br></br>2002 43 395 21 326 1 316 0 958 0 66 995 184 </br>2003 42 567 22 188 1 353 0 1 201 1 637 68 946 189 </br>2004 40 665 21 688 1 342 32 1 182 1 702 66 611 182 </br></br>2005 43 817 23 124 1 439 32 522 1 726 70 660 194 </br>2006 42 240 22 270 1 279 32 1 259 1 632 68 712 188 </br>2007 38 295 21 886 1 106 32 1 544 2 949 65 812 180 </br></br>2008 37 207 21 849 1 096 32 1 749 3 210 65 143 178 </br>2009 36 752 21 174 1 065 32 2 402 3 106 64 531 177 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department  City of San Diego. </br></br> 1  Wastewater System consists of the Metropolitan System  collects and treats the wastewater generated by the City </br>and 15 other agencies  and the Municipal System  all elements required for the collection and conveyance of the </br>wastewater generated by the City . </br> 2  The City does not treat flows through the Escondido Plant or the San Elijo Plant. </br>  WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS </br> General </br> </br>Wastewater System operations are subject to Federal  State  and local environmental </br>regulations that primarily address the quality of effluent that may be discharged from the </br></br>Wastewater System  the disposal of sludge generated by the Wastewater System  and the </br></br>nature of waste material  particularly industrial waste  discharged into the collection system. </br></br>The Federal regulations that have the most significant effect on the Wastewater System are the </br></br>Clean Water Act  which is administered by the U.S. EPA  the State Water Board and the </br></br>Regional Water Board  the Federal Clean Air Act  and the Federal Resource Conservation and </br></br>Recovery Act. The Wastewater System is in compliance with the major elements of each of the </br></br>foregoing regulations and other programs managed by the Federal government and the State.  </br>  33  </br>In addition to the general compliance mandates under the applicable Federal </br>regulations  the City is subject to the specific requirements of the Final Consent Decree  herein </br>defined  among the U.S. EPA and two environmental groups in connection with sewer spills </br></br>from December 1996 to April 2001. See “—Collection of Sewage—The Municipal Sub System </br></br>Collection System.” To date  the City has met the targets established as part of the Final </br></br>Consent Decree  except for one capital improvement project discussed below. </br> Collection of Sewage </br> </br>General</br>. The Clean Water Act and the NPDES permit system  including the Point </br>Loma Discharge Permit and the South Bay Discharge Permit issued thereunder  set effluent </br></br>limitations on the discharge of pollutants at treatment plants and generally prohibit the </br></br>discharge of pollutants into navigable waterways. Such prohibited discharges from the </br></br>collection system are also subject to injunctive or penalty proceedings by the Regional Water </br></br>Board. </br> </br>The Municipal Sub System Collection System</br>. The Clean Water Act prohibits the </br>discharge of sewer to surface waters  including discharges as a result of sanitary sewer </br></br>overflows  “SSOs”  into the collection system  except as authorized under an NPDES permit. </br></br>The California Water Code has a broader interpretation of SSOs  to include waste discharges </br></br>that could affect the quality of State waters  both surface and groundwater. </br> </br>To provide a consistent  statewide regulatory approach to address SSOs  the State </br>Water Board adopted the Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements for Sanitary Sewer </br></br>Systems  Water Quality Order No. 2006 0003 on May 2  2006  the “Sanitary Sewer Order” . </br></br>The Sanitary Sewer Order requires public agencies that own or operate sanitary sewer systems </br></br>to develop and implement a Sewer System Management Plan  “SSMP”  and report all SSOs to </br></br>the State Water Board’s SSO database. The SSMP must include an operation and maintenance </br></br>program  a current map of the sanitary sewer system  a rehabilitation and replacement plan  a </br></br>training plan and an inventory of equipment and replacement parts. </br> </br>In March 2001  two environmental groups filed suit against the City alleging that the </br>Municipal Sub System’s collection system was deficient as a result of sewer spills which had </br></br>occurred since December 1996. The U.S. EPA and the State filed similar suits against the City </br></br>in July 2003. The resulting settlements were memorialized in a Partial Consent Decree  the </br></br>“Partial Consent Decree”  which expired on June 30  2006 and a Second Partial Consent </br></br>Decree  the “Second Partial Consent Decree”   which expired on June 30  2007. Under the </br></br>Partial Consent Decree and the Second Partial Consent Decree  the City agreed to rehabilitate </br></br>or replace 200 miles of sewer pipeline by June 30  2007. In 2007  the City  the United States  </br></br>the EPA  the environmental groups entered into a final Consent Decree  the “Final Consent </br></br>Decree” and  together with the Partial Consent Decree and the Second Partial Consent Decrees  </br></br>the “Consent Decrees” .  </br> </br>The Final Consent Decree requires  among other things  increased sewer spill response </br>and tracking  increased root control and replacement or rehabilitation of an additional </br>250 </br>miles of pipeline between July 1  2007 and June 30  2013. The Final Consent Decree provides </br></br>that the City will replace or rehabilitate 30 miles of pipeline in Fiscal Year </br>2008  45 miles of </br>pipeline per year from Fiscal Year 2009 to Fiscal Year 2012  and 40 miles of pipeline in Fiscal </br></br>Year 2013. The City has replaced or rehab</br>ilitated approximately 49.48 miles of sewer pipeline  </br>including 4.48 miles banked in Fiscal Year 2009. Between July 1  2009  and January 31  2010  </br></br>the City awarded nine contracts for the completion of an additional 22.20 miles. The </br></br>additional 22.20 miles of pipeline  combined with the 4.48 of banked miles  14.49 of miles </br></br>completed as of December 31  2009  and a projected 3.83 miles from existing contracts  totals </br></br>45 miles of sewer pipeline for Fiscal Year 2010. The City may assert its right to extend the </br> 34  </br>deadline to replace or rehabilitate 45 miles of sewer pipeline during Fiscal Year </br>2010. The Final </br>Consent Decree states that if more than the specified miles of pipeline are replaced  </br>rehabilitated or permanently repaired in one year  the City may apply the excess amount </br></br>against the requirement to replace  rehabilitate  or permanently repair pipeline in any f</br>uture </br>year. In addition  the Final Consent Decree requires an analysis of the feasibility of relocating </br></br>sewer lines out of certain canyons by March 1  2009  which has been completed. Further  the </br></br>Final Consent Decree requires upgrades or replacement of more than 20 pump stations and </br></br>force main upgrades  and court supervision of these upgrades at least through July 2013. The </br></br>costs for bidding  constructing and completing the required work will depend on variables </br></br>such as the cost of materials and labor. No civil penalty payment was required under the </br></br>Consent Decrees. However  the Final Consent Decree provides that the City may be subject  at </br></br>the discretion of the Federal government  to various stipulated penalties for subsequent </br></br>violations of the provisions relating to  among other things  reporting and plan submissions  </br></br>compliance milestone and SSOs. To date  the City has not been subject to any penalties </br></br>resulting from alleged violations of the Final Consent Decree  but the City could be penalized </br></br>for late completion of Sewer Pump Station No. 79  SPS 79 . See APPENDIX A—“BASIC </br></br>FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND </br></br>CERTAIN EXCERPTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF </br></br>THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009.” </br> </br>The Final Consent Decree requires the City to construct improvements to SPS 79. SPS </br>79 has been in operation since 1984. The fac</br>ility is located in the Carmel Valley Pacific </br>Highlands Ranch area on the north side of San Dieguito Road  just east of the intersection of El </br></br>Camino Real and San Dieguito Road. Section VII.C.8 of the Final Consent Decree requires the </br></br>City to replace the pumps and motors  install a properly sized storage tank  complete </br></br>electrical upgrades  improve odor control  add SCADA controls and alarms  and install a </br></br>redundant force main approximately 8 230 feet in length. On September 18  2007  the City </br></br>Council authorized the City to negotiate an agreement with a local developer  Pardee Homes </br></br> Pardee   for the design and construction of upgrades to SPS 79. A future development project </br></br>of Pardee s depends on the improvements to SPS 79. </br> </br>The improvements to SPS 79 were supposed to be completed by December 2009. The </br>City extended the original deadline of December 2008 to December 2009 as permitted by </br></br>section VII.E.1 of the Final Consent Decree. The City does not have the authority under the </br></br>Final Consent Decree to extend the project deadline any further  so the improvements to SPS </br></br>79 became overdue as of January 1  2010. The EPA has the discretion to impose penalties on </br></br>the City for late completion pursuant to Section XI.B of the Final Consent Decree  increasing in </br></br>severity the later the project becomes: </br> </br>1 14 days late $750 day </br></br>15 28 days late $1 500 day </br></br>28 days or more late $3 000 day </br></br> </br>The improvements to SPS 79 are complete  except for punch list items   and SPS 79 </br>was returned to operation on April 6  2010. Based on that date of completion  the EPA could </br></br>penalize the City as much as $235 500. The causes of the delay include a significant re design </br></br>of the project due to improvements the City made upstream of the project to reduce inflow </br></br>and infiltration  bids for construction that were higher than expected  revised environmental </br></br>documents  and problems with delivery of the new pumps.  </br> </br>In addition  under the Final Consent Decree the City may now be penalized by the EPA </br>for SSOs over 1 000 gallons that reached navigable waters while the improvements to SPS 79 </br></br>were late. The City is exempt from EPA penalties for SSOs as long as it is in compliance with </br></br>the Final Consent Decree  but the delayed completion of improvements to SPS 79 temporarily </br> 35  </br>removed the exemption. Since January 1  2010  the City has experienced three SSOs that </br>reached navigable waters. Pursuant to Section XI.D of the Final Consent Decree  the City could </br></br>be penalized up to $6 000for these SSOs: </br> Date</br> Location</br> SSO </br>volume</br> Penalty</br> January 21  2010 </br>6241 Waverly Place </br>5 025 gallons </br>$2 000 </br>January 26  2010 7011 Linda Vista Road </br>1 025 gallons </br>$2 000 </br>February 27  2010 4635 Morena Boulevard 2 520 pallons </br>$2 000 </br> </br>These penalties for SSOs do not include any fines that may be imposed by the San </br>Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board  which is not signatory to the Final Consent </br></br>Decree. See APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  REQUIRED </br></br>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND CERTAIN EXCERPTS FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009.” </br> </br>Based on the Rate Model as of February 1  2010  the estimated average annual cost of </br>the Final Consent Decree for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2013 is $99 m</br>illion for capital projects  </br>including pipeline repair and replacement and $42 m</br>illion  based on the budget for WWC for </br>Fiscal Year 2010  for operations and maintenance  including increased cleaning of Wastewater </br></br>System facilities and funding for video monitoring. Such estimated average annual costs are </br></br>included in the Wastewater System’s budget and the fiscal information set forth in Table 5 and </br></br>Table 17. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM” and </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial Projections.” Some of the </br></br>upgrades required by the Final Consent Decree are under construction. Upgrades required by </br></br>the Final Consent Decree will be financed through the Wastewater System CIP  as described </br></br>under “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM—Background ” </br></br>including with a portion of the proceeds of the Series 2009A Bonds. See “WASTEWATER </br></br>SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS—Capital Improvement Projects—Municipal </br></br>Sub System Projects.” </br> </br>In 2001  the Department initiated a program to reduce SSOs by maintaining a system </br>wide cleaning schedule  video monitoring and assessing the condition of the oldest and most </br></br>problematic sewer lines in the Wastewater System and increasing the number of miles of sewer </br></br>lines replaced or rehabilitated annually. The Department has reduced sewer spills by 90% </br></br>between calendar year 2000 and calendar year 2009. During calendar year 2009  there were 38 </br></br>SSOs in the Municipal Sub System. </br> Treatment of Sewage </br> </br>The Clean Water Act generally requires that all wastewater treatment plants provide </br>secondary treatment for sewage before it is discharged into waterways. The Clean Water Act </br></br>allows wastewater treatment plants to apply for a waiver from the secondary treatment </br></br>standards for certain ocean discharges  a “Treatment Waiver” . The Clean Water Act grants </br></br>the U.S. EPA the discretion to grant or deny any Treatment Waiver. The South Bay Plant </br></br>complies with the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean Water Act and therefore does </br></br>not need a Treatment Waiver to operate. The City operates the Point Loma Plant subject to a </br></br>Treatment Waiver from the U.S. EPA that must be renewed every five years.  </br> </br>The City first applied for a Treatment Waiver for the Point Loma Plant in 1979. In July </br>1988  subsequent to unsuccessful efforts by the City to obtain a Treatment Waiver  the United </br></br>States of America  acting through the Department of Justice and the EPA  and the State sued </br></br>the City for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and the Point Loma Discharge Permit </br></br>due to sewer overflows  failure to meet the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean </br> 36  </br>Water Act and alleged irregularities in the City’s pretreatment program that regulates </br>industrial waste. As a result of this lawsuit  the City paid a penalty of $500 000  enacted a </br></br>low flow toilet ordinance as a credit project  and agreed to a stipulated final order  the “Final </br></br>Order”  that required certain improvements to the Wastewater System  all of which the City </br></br>has completed. The Final Order was eligible for termination on June 30  2003  but has not been </br></br>terminated because additional compliance orders were subsequently issued to address sewer </br></br>spills. See “—Collection of Sewage.” </br> </br>In 1994  at the request of the City  the United States Congress adopted OPRA  </br>amending the Clean Water Act to allow the City to apply for a Treatment Waiver  subject to </br></br>certain conditions. These conditions required  among other things  that the City achieve a </br></br>system capacity of 45 mgd of reclaimed wastewater per day by January 1  2010  remove not </br></br>less than 80% of TSS  on a monthly average  in the discharge of the Point Loma Plant  remove </br></br>not less than 58% of the biochemical oxygen demand  “BOD”   on an annual average  in the </br></br>discharge of the Point Loma Plant  and reduce the quantity of TSS discharged by the </br></br>Wastewater System into the Pacific Ocean during the period of modification. </br> </br>The City applied for and was granted the Point Loma Plant Treatment Waiver on </br>November 9  1995  such Treatment Waiver  granted pursuant to OPRA  is referred to herein as </br></br>a “Modified Permit” . The City must seek a renewal of its Modified Permit every five years if it </br></br>seeks to renew the Point Loma Discharge Permit without implementing secondary treatment. </br></br>The City has satisfied the OPRA requirements to achieve a system capacity of 45 mgd of </br></br>reclaimed wastewater per day by constructing the North City Plant  which has a capacity of 30 </br></br>mgd  and the South Bay Plant  which has a capacity of 15 mgd. The Point Loma Plant has </br></br>consistently met or exceeded the 80% removal requirement for TSS and the 58% removal of </br></br>BOD. The quantity of TSS discharged into the Pacific Ocean has conformed to OPRA </br></br>requirements and all other permit requirements. The City  the U.S. EPA and certain </br></br>environmental groups disagree on how the OPRA requirements may apply to future Modified </br></br>Permits. Currently  there are no active lawsuits or appeals with respect to the OPRA </br></br>requirements. </br> </br>The City filed a renewal application for a Modified Permit and received a Tentative </br>Decision and Tentative Order  the “2002 Tentative Order”  on February 11  2002. Initially  the </br></br>California Coastal Commission objected to the consistency certification submitted by the City </br></br>in connection with its request for a Modified Permit. The California Coastal Commission noted </br></br>three areas of concern that it believed needed to be addressed in order for the discharges to be </br></br>consistent with the applicable California Coastal Management Plan standards:  1  reduction in </br></br>permitted levels of mass emissions;  2  commitments for water reclamation; and  3  additional </br></br>monitoring provisions. Subsequently  the Regional Water Board modified its staff </br></br>recommended permit conditions and  1  reduced the total permitted mass emission loadings; </br></br> 2  requested annual reports from its staff of the City’s progress towards implementing water </br></br>reclamation  which would be independent of the NPDES permit  and noted that it could </br></br>impose future reclamation requirements if adequate progress was not forthcoming; and  3  </br></br>instructed its staff to review and prepare for future adoption by the Regional Water Board </br></br>modifications to the monitoring program  including specific provisions for deep ocean </br></br>receiving stations  human pathogens  and long term trends  which would also be independent </br></br>of the NPDES permit. </br> </br>In separate proceedings  the City successfully appealed the actions of the California </br>Coastal Commission and the Regional Water Board. In May 2002  the City resubmitted its </br></br>consistency certification to the California Coastal Commission and appealed the Commission’s </br></br>consistency certification objection to the Secretary of Commerce. In addition  the City appealed </br></br>the Regional Water Board’s NPDES permit action modifying the mass emission limits to the </br></br>State Water Board. In August 2002  the State Water Board ordered the mass emission limits to </br> 37  </br>be returned to the originally drafted levels. Subsequently  the City resubmitted its consistency </br>certification for the waiver as modified and ordered by the State Water Board. The State Water </br></br>Board concluded that the Regional Water Board had “…failed to make findings  either in its </br></br>order or during its deliberations  that justify reducing the mass emissions limit for TSS…in the </br></br>waste discharge requirements.” The California Coastal Commission then approved the </br></br>consistency certification for the treatment waiver. </br> </br>The City appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board  “EAB”  the provision of the </br>2002 Tentative Order requiring the City to comply with OPRA’s requirements regarding </br></br>reduction of the quantity of TSS discharged by the Wastewater System into the Pacific Ocean </br></br>over the period of modification. Concurrent with the City’s appeal  three environmental groups </br></br>filed challenges to the Modified Permit contesting the maximum discharge limit of TSS and the </br></br>EPA’s interpretation of the OPRA requirements. The City’s challenge and all the challenges </br></br>filed by such environmental groups have been resolved by a Joint Stipulation for Withdrawal </br></br>of Appeals  “Joint Stipulation for Withdrawal of Appeals”  in which the City agreed to </br></br> a  evaluate improved ocean monitoring;  b  pilot test biological aerated filters as a form of </br></br>technology to increase solids removal; and  c  study increased water reuse. The Joint </br></br>Stipulation for Withdrawal of Appeals was approved by the EAB on March 29  2004  and  as </br></br>approved  confirmed the provisions of the current Modified Permit through June 2008 and </br></br>reserved each of the parties’ respective position on OPRA to future permits.  </br> </br>Based upon the Department’s review of its annual biosolids reports from 2003 through </br>2007  the Department determined that the Metropolitan Biosolids Center and Point Loma </br></br>Plant satisfied the criteria for biosolids disposal required by the Clean Water Act and for the </br></br>use or disposal of sewage sludge that includes the analytical results. In December 2007  the </br></br>City submitted an application to the U.S. EPA to request a renewal of the Modified Permit for </br></br>the Point Loma Plant. The City’s renewal application followed the same conventions as </br></br>previous applications relative to OPRA. The U.S. EPA has permitted the City to operate </br></br>pursuant to the existing Modified Permit until it renders a final decision with respect to the </br></br>City’s renewal application because the City filed a renewal application in a timely manner. The </br></br>City received a Tentative Decision and Tentative Order to approve the Modified Permit for an </br></br>additional five years  the “2008 Tentative Order”  from the U.S. EPA on December 2  2008. In </br></br>January 2009  the City Council approved a resolution authorizing the City to negotiate and </br></br>execute an agreement with two local environmental groups regarding the Modified Permit for </br></br>the Point Loma Plant. Pursuant to such agreement  the two environmental groups agreed not </br></br>to challenge the 2008 Tentative Order and the City is obligated to research options to increase </br></br>the use of reclaimed wastewater and decrease discharges to the Pacific Ocean from the Point </br></br>Loma Plant for a total cost not to exceed $2 million. The U.S. EPA and the Regional Water </br></br>Board held an initial  joint hearing in January 2009 to accept public comment on the 2008 </br></br>Tentative Order. In June 2009  the State of California  Regional Water Quality Control Board  </br></br>concurred with the EPA and concluded the public hearing process by unanimously approving </br></br>the modified permit. On October 7  2009 the California Coastal Commission voted 8 to 4 to </br></br>approve the modified permit with the condition that the City come back in 2 years with the </br></br>Recycled Water Study. On March 12  2010  the California Coastal Commission adopted </br></br>findings in support of their action on October 7  2009  and concurred with the consistency </br></br>certification for the proposed waiver. Modified Permits are reviewed by the U.S. EPA every </br></br>five years. See “THE WASTEWATER SYSTEM—Metropolitan Sub System Facilities—Point </br></br>Loma Plant.” </br> </br>Although the City has obtained two successive Modified Permits from the EPA  the </br>City can give no assurances that the U.S. EPA will renew or grant Modified Permits to the City </br></br>in the future. If the City does not obtain a renewal of the Modified Permit  or any subsequent </br></br>Modified Permit   the City may no longer be permitted to continue discharging sewage from </br></br>the Point Loma Plant without complying with the secondary treatment requirements of the </br> 38  </br>Clean Water Act. The City considered two alternatives to address this contingency. One of </br>these contemplates upgrading the Point Loma Plant with conventional secondary treatment </br></br>capabilities. The City also considered  subject to verification of its effectiveness  an alternative </br></br>to implement a new process for treating sewage at the Point Loma Plant that may entail less </br></br>capital but greater maintenance and operation costs. The City could also be required to build </br></br>additional solids processing facilities to reduce the burden at the Point Loma Plant or bring the </br></br>Point Loma Plant into compliance with the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean </br></br>Water Act if the quantity of TSS that the Wastewater System discharges into the Pacific Ocean </br></br>increases above the levels required by OPRA  as finally determined by the EPA. Pursuant to </br></br>the 2002 Tentative Order  a renewed Modified Permit w</br>ill be granted based on  among other </br>things  the continued satisfaction of the conditions established under OPRA  as set forth </br></br>above. </br> </br>The City estimates the cost of the alternatives to bring the Point Loma Plant into </br>compliance with the secondary treatment requirements of the Clean Water Act will be between </br></br>$800 million and $1.5 billion in capital costs  based on Fiscal Year </br>2008 calculations  if the </br>2008 Tentative Order is terminated and the Regional Water Board and U.S. EPA do not </br></br>approve the Modified Permit. The larger amount assumes that  among other things  the City </br></br>cannot access land from the United States Navy or the United States Park Service. Further  in </br></br>the event the waiver is not approved for renewal  the City estimates there would also be an </br></br>increase in operating and maintenance costs of approximately $40 million per year  including </br></br>additional energy and personnel costs  once the Point Loma Plant is fully operational at the </br></br>secondary treatment level. Such estimated costs are not reflected in the financial information </br></br>included in Table 5 and Table 17. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT </br></br>PROGRAM” and “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial </br></br>Projections.” </br> Discharge and Disposal of Sewage </br> </br>Enacted in 1972  the Clean Water Act is a comprehensive revision of prior Federal water </br>pollution control legislation requiring operators of wastewater treatment plants to operate </br></br>such facilities in accordance with NPDES permits which set forth discharge limitations and </br></br>reporting requirements applicable to wastewater treatment facilities. The NPDES permit sets </br></br>effluent limitations on what is discharged into any public waters and prohibits any non </br></br>authorized discharges such as sewer system overflows. The Point Loma Plant and the South </br></br>Bay Plant must each obtain an NPDES permit authorizing them to discharge sewage into the </br></br>ocean because  at present  all of the Wastewater System’s sewage that is discharged into the </br></br>ocean is discharged through either the Point Loma Plant or the South Bay Plant. The Regional </br></br>Water Board adopted Waste Discharge Requirements  “WDR”  for the Point Loma Plant on </br></br>April 10  2002  and authorized the U.S. EPA to issue the Point Loma Discharge Permit in </br></br>conjunction with the renewal of the Point Loma Plant’s NPDES permit for discharge to the </br></br>Pacific Ocean pursuant to the Clean Water Act. The conditions of the WDR were appealed to </br></br>the State Water Board by the City. The final permit was signed by the U.S. EPA Regional </br></br>Administrator on September 13  2002 and became effective on October 16  2002. The Regional </br></br>Water Board approved an addendum to the Point Loma Discharge Permit  “Addendum No. </br></br>1”  on June 11  2003. Addendum No. 1 modified the monitoring and reporting program of the </br></br>Point Loma Discharge Permit to incorporate recommendations of the Southern California </br></br>Coastal Water Research Project’s Model Monitoring Program for Large Ocean Discharges in </br></br>Southern California. The Regional Water Board adopted waste discharge requirements for the </br></br>South Bay Plant on November 8  2006  and authorized the issuance of the South Bay </br></br>Discharge Permit for discharges into the Pacific Ocean. The South Bay Discharge Permit </br></br>became effective January 1  2007 and is scheduled to expire January 1  2012.  </br>  39  </br>In 1993  the U.S. EPA promulgated its “Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage </br>Sludge”  Code of Federal Regulations Title 40  Part 503   which established  among other </br>things  pollutant limitations  operational standards  management practices and other </br></br>provisions intended to protect public health. In addition to Federal requirements  the City </br></br>must also comply with State Water Board adopted Water Quality Order No. 2004 12 DWQ  </br></br>which expands upon Federal regulations with respect to biosolids and streamlines the </br></br>regulatory process for the use of biosolids as a soil amendment.  </br> </br>The City must also comply with effluent water quality based State requirements. The </br>California Water Code Article 4  commencing with Section 13160  of Chapter 3 of Division 7 </br></br>requires the State Water Board to formulate and adopt a water quality control plan for the </br></br>ocean waters of the State known as the California Ocean Plan  the “Ocean Plan” . The Ocean </br></br>Plan sets forth waste discharge limitations and monitoring and enforcement guidelines to </br></br>ensure that water quality objectives are met. Section 303 c  1  of the Clean Water Act and </br></br>Section 13170.2 b  of the State Water Code require that ocean water quality standards be </br></br>reviewed at least once every three years. In the event significant changes to the discharge </br></br>requirement for TSS are approved with respect to the Ocean Plan  future waivers for the Point </br></br>Loma Plant may be threatened. In September  2009  the State Water Resources Control Board </br></br>approved what it characterized as non substantive amendments to the California Ocean Plan </br></br>as part of its Triennial Review. The 2009 amended Ocean Plan is pending approval by the </br></br>Office of Administrative Law. The TSS limitations in Table A of the Ocean Plan are </br></br>unchanged.  </br> </br>The City’s proposed water reclamation projects are subject to the Porter Cologne Water </br>Quality Control Act of 1969  as amended  the “Porter Cologne Act”  and are being designed in </br></br>consultation with State officials to comply with its requirements. The Porter Cologne Act </br></br>directly addresses the issues of water reclamation and reuse. A declared policy of the law is </br></br>the development of facilities to reclaim wastewater to supplement existing surface and </br></br>underground water supplies to meet their water requirements. The law requires the State </br></br>Department of Health Services to establish statewide reclamation criteria for each type of use </br></br>where such use involves public health.  </br> </br>State law AB 939 required the City to divert at least 50% of all solid waste from landf</br>ill disposal by January 1  2000. For calendar year 2009  the City estimates that it diverted </br></br>approximately 99% of biosolids from landfill disposal. Biosolids diversion is an integral part </br></br>of the City’s compliance with AB 939  as biosolids were disposed of in the City’s landf</br>ill during the baseline year used for calculating the diversion rate. The City entered into a </br></br>franchise disposal agreement with a private company pursuant to which the company shall be </br></br>responsible for the disposal of all biosolids generated at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center </br></br>through a combination of land application and alternative daily cover methods for landfill use. </br></br>The City is considering alternative sludge disposal methods to employ in the event regulations </br></br>change in the future. </br> Industrial Wastewater Control Program </br> </br>The Point Loma Discharge Permit  the South Bay Discharge Permit and various Federal </br>regulations require that the City control discharges from the Wastewater System by </br></br>implementing an industrial wastewater control program  an “IWCP” . The Metropolitan Sub </br></br>System has had an IWCP in effect since 1972. The Metropolitan Sub System’s IWCP was </br></br>formally approved by the U.S. EPA in 1983. The Metropolitan Sub System’s IWCP </br></br>administers and enforces Federal general and specific discharge prohibitions  Federal </br></br>categorical pretreatment standards  treatment plant specific local limits and local source </br></br>control programs within the City. The City’s Industrial Waste Ordinance lists Federal general </br></br>and specific prohibitions and authorizes the issuance of permits  which include applicable </br> 40  </br>Federal and local discharge standards. The City’s Industrial Waste Ordinance also authorizes </br>administrative penalties and other enforcement measures in response to permit or ordinance </br></br>violations. The City has entered into inter jurisdictional pretreatment agreements  each  a </br></br>“Pretreatment Agreement” and  collectively  the “Pretreatment Agreements”  with thirteen of </br></br>the Participating Agencies whose sewage is treated by the Department; agreements with the </br></br>remaining two Participating Agencies are being finalized. The Pretreatment Agreements </br></br>specify that each Participating Agency must either implement an equivalent IWCP or </br></br>authorize the City to administer an IWCP in their respective agencies. The City currently </br></br>administers the IWCP in each of the Participating Agencies. Collectively  the IWCP operated </br></br>by the City regulates 1 466 dischargers throughout the Metropolitan Sub System’s tributary </br></br>area. In addition  inspections have determined that an additional 2 191 fac</br>ilities do not require </br>permits at this time. Annual Pretreatment Program audits by the U.S. EPA and the Regional </br></br>Water Quality Control Board have determined that the IWCP is in compliance with Point </br></br>Loma Discharge Permit  South Bay Discharge Permit and Federal program requirements.  </br> Grant and Loan Related Regulatory Requirements </br> </br>The City is subject to regulatory requirements  in addition to those described above  as </br>a condition of receipt of Federal grants received from the EPA  State grants and SRF low </br></br>interest loans under the Clean Water Act for the planning and construction of various </br></br>improvements to the Wastewater System. Among other grant related requirements are </br></br>guidelines concerning planning methodologies  design criteria  construction activities  and the </br></br>operation  maintenance and financing of facilities. </br> </br>In connection with an U.S. EPA grant of approximately $76 million that the City </br>received and used for the construction of the North City Plant and other wastewater projects  </br></br>the grant contained a condition that the City attempt to meet the goal of beneficial reuse of </br></br>25% of the flows treated at the North City Plant by December 31  2003 and 50% by December </br></br>31  2010. The City has d</br>iligently reported its progress and efforts to meet the goals set forth in </br>the grant. The U.S. EPA has acknowledged the City’s good faith efforts toward compliance </br></br>with the beneficial reuse goals set forth in its grant and has not imposed any penalties or </br></br>sanctions under the grant agreement. During Fiscal Year 2009  the \n",

              " achieved beneficial </br></br>reuse of 28% of the flows treated at the North City Plant. The City is continuing to explore </br></br>alternative means to increase reclaimed water use. See “THE WASTEWATER SYSTEM—</br></br>Metropolitan Sub System Facilities—North City Water Reclamation Plant.” </br> </br>As a condition of certain other Federal grants  the State Water Board  as the delegate of </br>the EPA  must approve the sewer service charge structures of the City and the Participating </br></br>Agencies. Such service charge structures require the recovery of annual operations  </br></br>maintenance and replacement costs from users of the system in a proportionate manner </br></br>according to the customer’s level of use. Such factors as volume  infiltration inflow  delivery </br></br>flow rate  and strength of sewage are to be considered for determining proportionate use. </br></br>Sewer service charge rates for all retail users are reviewed periodically and established at a </br></br>level necessary to generate sufficient revenues to recover the annual operations  maintenance </br></br>and replacement costs. Sewer service charge rates for users are established to recognize the </br></br>volume and strength characteristics of wastewater contributed to the Wastewater System. The </br></br>City Council has taken various actions to adjust the Wastewater System’s rate structure  </br></br>including in connection with periodic review of the distribution of cost of services. See </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—City Council Actions Relating to </br></br>Rate Changes.” The City’s rate structure has been approved by the State Water Board and no </br></br>grant funds or costs under grant funded programs have been disallowed based on the nature </br></br>of the rate structures.  </br> </br>  41  </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM </br> Background </br> The Department prepares an 11 year Wastewater System CIP  consisting of the current </br>budget year and a 10 year projection  on an annual basis  and the City incorporates the first </br></br>year of such plan into the Wastewater System’s annual budget. The EPM of the Department </br></br>also prepares a 25 year internal Wastewater System CIP model in connection with the </br></br>consideration of longer term projects. The Wastewater System CIP presents the total estimated </br></br>project cost since project inception  including expenditures  encumbrances  continuing </br></br>appropriations  the annual budget for the current fiscal year and projections of expenses in </br></br>subsequent years. The general objectives of the Wastewater System CIP are to meet Federal </br></br>and State requirements and City policy regarding water pollution control  to provide </br></br>satisfactory levels of service to users of the Wastewater System  and to maintain the integrity </br></br>of the Wastewater System.  </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP is an ongoing capital expenditure program. During the </br>1990’s  the City completed several large wastewater treatment plant projects in response to </br></br>litigation involving violations of the Clean Water Act. Beginning in 2000  the focus of the </br></br>Wastewater System CIP shifted to the Municipal Sub System. In April 2002  the City received </br></br>an Administrative Order from the U.S. EPA directing the City to prepare and submit a plan </br></br>for rehabilitation and replacement of sewer pipes and structures. In October </br>2007  the City </br>signed the Final Consent Decree with the EPA  which obligates the City to replace or </br></br>rehabilitate </br>250 miles of sewer pipeline between July 2007 and June 2013 and to replace or </br>rehabilitate a number of trunk sewers and pump stations by certain dates. See </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Collection of Sewage—The </br></br>Municipal Sub System Collection System.” </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP includes annual allocations projects  which are </br>programmed expenditures that allow the City to plan for the expansion  renovation  relocation  </br></br>or replacement of facilities and equipment that have reached or exceeded their anticipated </br></br>service life  provides for emergency and accelerated construction needs  and provides for </br></br>capital improvement project contingency needs. Any amount not allocated to a component </br></br>task in a particular year is returned to the contributing fund. In addition  the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP includes phased funding to accommodate  appropriate and contract for large </br></br>projects to maximize the City’s use of available funds by identifying defined portions or </br></br>phases of projects on a contingent basis. The Wastewater System CIP also uses split funding  </br></br>which allows two different revenue sources to be used to fund a capital project on a </br></br>percentage basis. </br> </br>Any ongoing project under the Wastewater System CIP  other than an annual </br>allocation  that was initiated prior to the current Fiscal Year will have expenditures  </br></br>encumbrances or continuing appropriations in the current Fiscal Year. The Department may </br></br>budget additional funding for such projects during current and future Fiscal Years depending </br></br>upon project scheduling. The Department includes the amounts it has budgeted for each Fiscal </br></br>Year in an annual appropriation ordinance  each  an “Annual Appropriation Ordinance”   </br></br>which becomes effective upon adoption by the City Council. Each Annual Appropriation </br></br>Ordinance authorizes the City to appropriate revenues for expenditures relating to capital </br></br>improvement projects for the applicable Fiscal Year. In addition  each Annual Appropriation </br></br>Ordinance provides guidance regarding the administration of the Wastewater System CIP. </br></br>Modifications to a project’s budget may occur during the course of the Fiscal Year through </br></br>City Council action. Appropriations for projects which are contained in the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP for the Fiscal Year 2010 have been approved in the Annual Appropriation </br> 42  </br>Ordinance for the Fiscal Year 2010. However  the City is not obligated to expend funds based </br>on any projections made for Fiscal Years 2011 to 2020 because such projections are not </br></br>contained within the Annual Appropriation Ordinance. </br> </br>The Department currently expects that approximately 80% of the costs of the </br>Wastewater System CIP will be funded with the proceeds of debt financing and the remaining </br></br>20% will be paid on a pay as you go basis from Net System Revenues. Table 5 sets forth the </br></br>Wastewater System CIP for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014 and the expected allocations </br></br>between the Municipal Sub System and Metropolitan Sub Systems.  </br> TABLE 5 </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br>PROJECTED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM EXPENDITURE SUMMARY</br> 1  Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Expected Projects </br>2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 TOTAL </br>Municipal Sub System Projects       </br>      Trunk Sewers </br>$14 214 $ 45 511 $ 47 433 $ 22 919 $ 27 718 $157 795 </br>      Pipelines </br>40 743 51 857 68 770 77 571 60 356 299 297 </br>      Pump Stations </br>10 725 13 722 6 010 6 819 943 38 219 </br>      Miscellaneous </br>0 </br>0 0 0 1 885 </br>1 885 </br>Subtotal Municipal Sub System Projects $65 682 </br>$111 090 </br>$122 213 </br>$107 309 </br>$ 90 902 </br>$497 196 </br>       </br>Metropolitan </br>Sub System </br>Projects       </br>      Treatment Plants </br>$ 2 379 $ 13 449 $ 36 029 $ 27 156 $ 14 049 $ 93 062 </br>      Pipelines </br>0 0 0 0 0 0 </br>      Large Pump Stations </br>3 337 6 401 1 157 3 088 7 584 21 567 </br>      Miscellaneous </br>3 487 </br>5 056 </br>6 281 </br>5 677 </br>5 315 </br>25 816 </br>Subtotal Metropolitan Sub System Projects 9 203 </br>24 906 </br>43 467 </br>35 921 </br>26 948 </br>140 445 </br>TOTAL </br>$74 885 </br>$135 996 </br>$165 680 </br>$143 230 </br>$117 850 </br>$637 641 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department  City of San Diego; Reflects Rate Case as of February 1  </br>2010. </br> 1  Includes an assumed 3.5 percent annual increase in Wastewater System CIP project costs for Fiscal Years 2012 </br>through 2014.  Includes projects required by the Final Consent Decree and those required as part of the annual </br>maintenance of the Wastewater System. </br> Capital Improvement Projects </br> Municipal Sub System Projects</br>. The following is a summary description of certain </br>projects identified in the Wastewater System CIP to be constructed for the Municipal Sub </br></br>System  including Annual Allocation projects in all of these categories. </br> </br>1. Trunk Sewers—These projects include replacement or rehabilitation of existing </br>trunk sewers  larger than 15 inches in diameter  due to deterioration or </br></br>insufficient capacity.  </br> </br>2. Pipelines—These projects include replacement or rehabilitation of various sewer </br>mains located throughout the City due to deterioration or insufficient capacity. </br> </br>3. Pump Stations—These projects include upgrades  renovations  restoration and </br>replacement of major equipment at the Municipal Sub System’s pump stations.  </br> </br>4. Miscellaneous—Other municipal projects such as developer projects. </br></br>  43  </br>Metropolitan Sub System</br>. The following is a summary description of certain projects </br>identified in the Wastewater System CIP to be constructed for the Metropolitan Sub System  </br>including annual allocation projects in the majority of these categories. </br> </br>1. Treatment Plants—These projects include renovations or upgrades at the North </br>City Plant  the South Bay Plant  the Metropolitan Biosolids Center and the Point </br></br>Loma Plant to implement operating efficiencies  optimize the existing facilities </br></br>and comply with revised regulatory and operation plan requirements.  </br> </br>2. Pipelines—These projects include replacement or rehabilitation of various sewer </br>interceptors which are deteriorating or have insufficient capacity. </br> </br>3. Large Pump Stations—These projects include upgrades  renovations  </br>restoration and replacement of major equipment for Metropolitan System Pump </br></br>Stations  Pump Station No. 1 and Pump Station No. 2. </br> </br>4. Miscellaneous—These projects include  among other things  projects for </br>improvements to the Facilities Distributed Controls System  the Environmental </br></br>Monitoring and Technical Services Lab  management of wet weather flows  the </br></br>Metropolitan Facilities Control System Upgrade  which includes upgrades to the </br></br>distributed controls system at the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  Point Loma </br></br>Plant  North City Plant and South Bay Plant and Phase I of the Weather Storage </br></br>Facility  which will implement intermittent stream discharge of reclaimed water </br></br>from the North City Plant during heavy rain to reduce the capacity demand on </br></br>the downstream sewer system. </br> Capital Improvement Financing Plan </br> </br>Table 6 below sets forth the projected sources and uses of funds for the Wastewater </br>System CIP for the Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014. New bond issues are assumed to be bonds </br></br>secured by Installment Payments that are Parity Obligations. The amount of Installment </br></br>Payments securing Parity Obligations may decrease if any of the new bond issues are not </br></br>issued as Parity Obligations. Subject to final approval by the State Water Board in Fiscal Year </br></br>2010 the City w</br>ill incur an additional Parity Obligation in the form of the Additional SRF Loan </br>of $46.4 m</br>illion. The potential receipt of the Additional SRF Loan is not included in the City’s </br>Rate Model. However  the receipt of such funds is not expected to affect the overall projections </br></br>because the Department will reduce its aggregate borrowing by a like amount for the period </br></br>covered by its Rate Model. The State is currently reviewing an application for an additional </br></br>SRF Loan of $80 m</br>illion for pipe rehabilitation with a response anticipated in early Fiscal Year </br>2011. </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP includes the costs of the projects described in Table 5 </br>above. The 2010 Adopted Department Budget continues to focus the Wastewater System CIP </br></br>on the annual appropriations  which include  among other things  the replacement of sewer </br></br>mains  pipeline repair and rehabilitation  and upgrades to trunk sewers and pump stations as </br></br>required by the Consent Decree. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS—Collection of Sewage.” In the event the City fails to obtain successive </br></br>Modified Permits or if the City fails to obtain clarification of OPRA in its favor  whether by </br></br>judicial or legislative means   the capital costs of the Wastewater System CIP could increase </br></br>substantially. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Treatment </br></br>of Sewage.” If the City is obligated to incur greater costs in repairing and rehabilitating the </br></br>Municipal Sub System than the City projects herein  the capital costs of the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP could increase substantially.

Under CEQA  a project which may have a significant effect on the </br></br>environment and which is to be carried out or approved by a public agency must comply with </br></br>a comprehensive environmental review process  including the preparation of an Environmental </br></br>Impact Report  “EIR” . An EIR reflects not only an independent technical analysis of the </br></br>project’s potential impacts  but also the comments of other agencies with some form of </br></br>jurisdiction over the project and the comments of interested members of the public. Contents </br></br>of an EIR include a detailed statement of the project’s potentially significant environmental </br></br>effects; any such effects which cannot be avoided if the project is implemented; mitigation </br></br>measures proposed to eliminate or minimize such effects; alternatives to the proposed project; </br></br>and any significant irreversible environmental changes which would result from the project. If </br></br>an agency determines that the project itself will not have a significant effect on the </br></br>environment  it may adopt a written statement  called a “Negative Declaration”  to that effect </br></br>and need not prepare an EIR. A Mitigated Negative Declaration  “MND”  is appropriate for </br></br>projects that could potentially result in a significant environmental impact  but revisions or </br></br>standard mitigation measures are incorporated into the project that clearly mitigate the </br></br>impact. Statutory exemptions are activities that are not subject to CEQA. Wastewater System </br></br>CIP projects can also be exempted if they fit a specific “category” of activities identified by the </br></br>State Legislature. Once an agency approves or determines to carry out a project  either </br></br>following an EIR process or after adopting a negative declaration  it must file a notice of such </br> 45  </br>determination. Any action or proceeding challenging the agency’s determination must be </br>brought within 30 days following the filing of such notice. </br> </br>As part of its regular planning and budgetary process  the City prepares in accordance </br>with local  State and Federal law and regulations separate environmental documents for each </br></br>Wastewater System CIP project and evaluates the project under the City’s environmental </br></br>impact review procedures  which were developed in compliance with State law and </br></br>regulations. The City requires that all environmental documents and evaluations be completed </br></br>prior to any authorization of funding for construction by the City Council and the Mayor. </br> </br>The Wastewater System CIP involves replacement  upgrading and increasing capacity </br>of existing facilities. Accordingly  the City does not believe that environmental considerations </br></br>will adversely affect the completion of the Wastewater System CIP within the contemplated </br></br>budget or the current timetable.  </br> Project Management for the Wastewater System Capital Improvement Program </br> </br>The Department and the Engineering and Capital Projects Department  “E&amp;CP”   </br>which is a department within the City’s Public Works Group  are responsible for the </br></br>implementation of the Wastewater System CIP. The Department is responsible for selecting the </br></br>projects that are included in the Wastewater Capital Improvement Program. Selection of such </br></br>projects involves  among other things  assessing conditions  sewer modeling  preparing </br></br>planning reports  prioritizing projects  scheduling and allocating the budget. Once the </br></br>Department determines that a particular project should proceed  the Department sends a </br></br>scope of work  planning report or 10% design  as appropriate  and the proposed schedule and </br></br>budget to E&amp;CP. E&amp;CP is responsible for the design  construction and start up of all </br></br>Wastewater System CIP projects.  </br> </br>Each Fiscal Year  the Department and E&amp;CP enter into a Service Level Agreement </br> each  an “SLA”  which outlines the responsibilities of each department as it relates to the </br></br>planning  design and construction of sewer improvements with respect to sewer mains  trunk </br></br>sewers  pump stations and treatment plants. Pursuant to the SLA  E&amp;CP provides engineering </br></br>services including project management  design  environmental  permitting  land acquisition  </br></br>scheduling  budget and construction management. E&amp;CP implements the Wastewater System </br></br>CIP from design of projects to completion  including capitalization of the final asset and </br></br>management of warranty issues  as directed by the Department. The Department provides </br></br>overall direction and policy for planning  financing  and operations and maintenance of the </br></br>Wastewater System. Further  the Department funds the positions and non personnel expenses  </br></br>which are necessary for the service provider of a particular project to fulfill its responsibilities.  </br> Contract Disputes </br> </br>From time to time  the City is engaged in disputes with the contractors and </br>subcontractors working on the Wastewater System CIP. As of January 4  2010  there are no </br></br>pending contract disputes with vendors or contractors working on the Wastewater System CIP </br></br>in excess of $1 million. </br> Insurance for Construction </br> </br>The City requires the consultant or contractor selected to design or construct a </br>Wastewater System CIP project to provide minimum insurance therefor. Design consultants </br></br>are required to provide at a minimum commercial general liability insurance of $1 million per </br></br>occurrence  $2 million aggregate   commercial auto liability insurance of $1 million per </br></br>occurrence  workers’ compensation insurance of $1 million  architect and engineer’s </br> 46  </br>professional liability insurance of $1 million per occurrence  $2 million aggregate  and errors </br>and omissions insurance for design build projects. Construction contractors are required to </br></br>provide at a minimum  among other things  commercial and general liability insurance </br></br>aggregate limit of $2 million  other than products completed operations  and $2 million </br></br> products completed operations   personal injury insurance of $1 million each occurrence  </br></br>commercial automobile liability insurance of $1 million combined single limit per accident  and </br></br>contractors builders risk property insurance in an amount equal to 115% of the contract value. </br></br>Further  depending upon the size and scope of a project  the City’s Risk Management </br></br>Department may require increased insurance coverage at any time and from time to time </br></br>based upon its assessment of the degree of risk for such project. </br> </br> WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS </br> General </br> </br>The Department manages and operates the Wastewater System with funds derived </br>primarily from service charges which are deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund. The Sewer </br></br>Revenue Fund was established in 1956. Funds in the Sewer Revenue Fund are used for the </br></br>operation  maintenance and capital improvement of the Metropolitan Sub System and the </br></br>Municipal Sub System. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—</br></br>Establishment  Calculation and Collection of Sewer Service Charges.”  </br> </br>The primary sources of moneys deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund are derived from </br>revenues generated by sewer service charges to City residents and commercial enterprises  </br></br>capacity charges on new  additional or larger connections to the Wastewater System within the </br></br>City  revenues from the Participating Agencies pursuant to the Regional Sewage Disposal </br></br>Agreement and interest income on fund balances. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL </br></br>OPERATIONS—Participating Agencies; Regional Wastewater Disposal Agreement; </br></br>Transportation Agreements.” The City also deposits into the Sewer Revenue Fund revenues </br></br>received from the United States Navy pursuant to “Department of the Navy Negotiated Water </br></br>and Sewage Contract” by and between the City and United States Navy. </br> Budgetary Process </br> </br>The City budgets revenues and expenditures to support the costs the Department </br>incurs to operate and maintain the Wastewater System. Each April  the Mayor submits the </br></br>Department’s budget for the following fiscal year to the City Council for approval. Budget </br></br>estimates for the Wastewater System CIP are prepared based upon the needs of the </br></br>Metropolitan Sub System and the Municipal Sub System. Cost information and schedules </br></br>provided by the design and operations staff are used to prepare the capital budget for the </br></br>Wastewater System. The Department prepares an 11 year Wastewater System CIP each year </br></br>as part of its internal budget process. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM CAPITAL </br></br>IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM—Background.” The Wastewater System CIP consists of </br></br>anticipated costs and a schedule for projects planned for completion and is based on planning </br></br>information from prior years  progress toward stated goals and objectives  future and long </br></br>term needs and planning information developed during the Wastewater System CIP planning </br></br>cycle. The Wastewater System CIP provides the basis for review of the annual budget for the </br></br>Wastewater System CIP and near term projects and is divided into projects for each of the </br></br>Municipal Sub System and the Metropolitan Sub System to address their respective </br></br>requirements. </br>  47  </br>The City commissions a wastewater cost of service  rate design and capacity fee study </br>periodically. The goal of each study is to develop recommendations for the establishment of </br>fair and equitable sewer rates for the City’s users and a revenue program that will be </br></br>acceptable to the State Water Board. Each study includes a review of the City’s financial plan </br></br>or rate case  usage characteristics  and rate structure. The City expects to commission the next </br></br>wastewater cost of service study in calendar year 2011. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Calculation and Collection of Capacity Charges.”  </br> Establishment  Calculation and Collection of Sewer Service Charge Revenue and </br></br>Treatment Plant Services Revenue </br> </br>Sewer Service Charge Revenue</br>. The City deposits sewer service charge revenues  which are </br>primarily derived from sewer service charges to City residents and commercial enterprises into </br></br>the Sewer Revenue Fund. Sewer service charges to City utility customers are collected on a </br></br>municipal bill  which also includes water charges and storm drain fees. Bills are rendered on a </br></br>bi monthly basis for single family and most multifamily dwellings and on a monthly basis for </br></br>industrial  commercial  and large multifamily dwellings. In accordance with the provisions of </br></br>the City Municipal Code  these funds are administered in an enterprise account separate from </br></br>the City’s General Fund. </br> </br>The City establishes fees based upon the costs incurred by the City to collect  treat and </br>discharge wastewater and pay for required capital improvements.

The billing inserts are </br></br>designed to allow the organization to raise funds for the hiring and payment of experts who </br></br>will review and evaluate the City’s future sewer rate setting activities. To satisfy the terms of </br></br>the Shames Settlement  the City temporarily increased existing sewer rates for all City sewer </br></br>customers by 3.05% on November 1  2007 and increased existing sewer rates by an additional </br></br>3.05% on May 1  2008. For “eligible” single family residential sewer customers  the City w</br>ill reverse the two 3.05% rate increases applicable to all City sewer customers and pay the </br></br>settlement obligation in the form of a monthly credit which is estimated to be $3.25 per month. </br></br>Per the Shames Settlement  “eligible” single family residential customers are those who </br></br>received sewer service to their property in the ten year period prior to October 1  2004. The rate </br></br>reversal and monthly credit for single family residential customers will end and the City will </br></br>terminate the two 3.05% rate increases attributable to the Shames Settlement when the $40 </br></br>million settlement amount has been raised and distributed according to the Shames </br></br>Settlement. The City expects this to occur for all single family residential customers in the fall </br></br>of 2011. See “LITIGATION” for a description of ongoing litigation regarding multifamily </br></br>customers and the California Restaurant Management System that may impact City Council </br></br>actions relating to sewer service rates.  </br> </br>Table 9 sets forth the sewage service charges approved by the City Council in the last </br>five fiscal years including sewer service charges that are currently in effect and those that have </br></br>been approved and will be effective on May 1  </br>2010. </br>  51  </br>TABLE 9 </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br>APPROVED RATE INCREASES FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL   </br>MULTIFAMILY AND COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2010</br> 1   Unaudited  </br>       Commercial &amp; Industrial Customers</br> 3 </br> Effective Date </br>Single </br>Family </br>Domestic</br> 2  All </br>Classes </br>% Rate </br>Increase </br>Uniform </br>Base Fee </br>Single </br>Family </br>Residential </br>$ HCF </br>water </br>Multifamily </br> Other </br>Domestic  </br>Usage Fee </br>$ HCF water </br>$ HCF </br>Monthly </br>Wastewater </br>Flow </br>$ LB </br>Total </br>Suspended </br>Solids </br>$ LB </br>Chemical </br>Oxygen </br>Demand </br>October 1  2004</br> 4 </br> $32.72 N A $10.53 $2.563 $3.461 $2.5613 $0.3994 $0.1436 </br>March 1  2005 35.17 7.50 11.32 2.755 3.721 2.7534 0.4294 0.1544 </br>May 1  2007 38.32 8.75 12.31 2.890 4.038 3.0257 0.4431 0.1801 </br>November 1  </br>2007–Shames</br> 5 </br> 39.49 3.05 12.69 2.978 4.161 3.1180 0.4566 0.1856 </br>May 1  2008 42.94 8.75 13.80 3.239 4.525 3.3908 0.4966 0.2018 </br>May 1  2008–</br>Shames</br> 5 </br> 44.25 3.05 14.22 3.338 4.663 3.4942 0.5117 0.2080 </br>May 1  2009 47.35 7.00 15.21 3.571 4.990 3.7388 0.5475 0.2225 </br>May 1  2010 50.67 7.00 16.28 3.821 5.339 4.0005 0.5859 0.2381 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department  City of San Diego.  </br> 1  Includes sewer service charges that are currently in effect and those that have been approved by the City Council </br>and will be effective on May 1  </br>2010. </br> 2  Represents the average monthly amount and new customer amount. </br></br> 3  Commercial and Industrial Customers’ monthly charges are based upon volume of flow  TSS  and COD </br>included effective October 1  2004. </br> 4  Reflects restructuring of sewer service charges which adds COD as a cost parameter and a uniform base fee for </br>all single family residential customers  multifamily residential customers and commercial and industrial </br>customers. </br> 5  On June 16  2004  a class action lawsuit  </br>Shames v. City of San Diego</br>  was filed against the City alleging that until </br>October 2004  when the City revised its sewer rate structure—See footnote  4    single family residential </br></br>customers were overcharged for sewer service  while other customers were undercharged. On May 18  2007  the </br>Superior Court for the County of San Diego approved an agreement to settle the lawsuit. This requires the City to </br></br>reimburse “eligible” single family residential customers a total of $40 m</br>illion  less $5 million for attorney’s </br>fees and other costs  over the next four years.  </br> Accounts Receivable </br> Typically  the City seeks to collect unpaid bills by:  i  issuing an initial shut off notice </br>25 days after a bill is issued;  ii  issuing a final shut off notice 38 days after a bill is issued; </br></br>and  iii  shutting off the customer’s water service 45 51 days after a bill is issued. This </br></br>procedure results in almost all past due bills being paid. If necessary  the City establishes time </br></br>payments for customers who are unable to pay a past due amount. Accounts closed with an </br></br>amount due and unpaid are referred to the City Treasurer for collection activities 75 days after </br></br>the bill is issued but unpaid. An allowance is taken each Fiscal Year for accounts receivable </br></br>that are not expected to be paid. During the Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009  accounts </br></br>receivable amounts outstanding for more than 120 days ranged from approximately $1.6 </br></br>million to approximately $2.6 million. Sewer service charges to City utility customers are </br></br>collected on the municipal sewer bill  which also includes water charges and storm drain fees. </br></br>Bills are currently invoiced every two months for single family dwellings and most multifamily </br></br>dwellings and on a monthly basis for all other customers. </br>  52  </br>Table 10 below sets forth information related to accounts receivable and number of </br>shut offs. </br> TABLE 10 </br>WASTEWATER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHUT OFFS </br> $ In Thousands  </br>For Fiscal Years 2005 to 2009 </br>   2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Sewer Service Revenue </br> 1 </br> $283 423 $286 416 $299 736 $325 048 $318 474 </br>Accounts Receivable</br> 2 </br> 421 157 $18 881 $21 541 $21 101 $20 112 </br>Accounts Receivable Over 120 </br>Days</br> 2  3 </br> $1 639 $2 557 $2 485 $2 193 $2 567 </br>Number of Shut Offs</br> 4 </br> 24 459 21 230 20 451 22 420 23 650 </br>    Sources: Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports for the indicated years for Sewer Service Revenue; Public Utilities </br>Department  City of San Diego  for all other line items. </br> 1  Audited. </br> 2  Excludes amounts payable by Participating Agencies. </br> 3   Estimated. </br> 4  Information provided by the Customer Information System does not differentiate between water and sewer </br>shut offs.

Capacity </br></br>fees are not treated as operating income for financial reporting purposes but are considered </br></br>System Revenues  deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund  and included in the calculation of </br></br>debt service coverage. Pursuant to State law  capacity fees are applied only to capital </br></br>expansion  bonds  contracts  or other indebtedness of the Wastewater System related to </br></br>expansion. Capacity fees are primarily collected on new construction within the City and </br></br>revenues therefrom vary based upon construction activity. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial Projections” below for a schedule of projected </br></br>capacity charges for the Municipal Sub System. </br>  53  </br>Table 11 below sets forth the Sewer Revenue Fund’s EDUs and Capacity Charge </br>Revenues for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 11 </br>MUNICIPAL SUB SYSTEM </br>SEWER UTILITY FUND  </br>HISTORICAL CAPACITY CHARGE REVENUES </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Fiscal Year </br>Equivalent  </br>Dwelling Units</br> 1 </br> Capacity Charge </br>Revenues</br> 2 </br> 2005 4 772 $14 665 </br>2006 5 150 $16 565 </br>2007 3 </br> 4 966 $16 610 </br>2008 3 492 $11 851 </br>2009 4 </br> 2 651 $10 361 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department and the Comptroller’s Office  City of San Diego. </br> 1  Unaudited. Declining number of EDUs reflects a decline in new construction. </br> 2  Unaudited supplemental information provided by the Comptroller’s Office  City of San Diego. </br> 3  From Fiscal Year 2006 to Fiscal Year 2007  the EDUs decreased while the capacity charge revenues increased </br>due to the increase in capacity charge from $3 710 to $4 124 in Fiscal Year 2007 pursuant to City Council </br>Resolution No. R 302378. </br> 4  Amount for Fiscal Year 2009 includes a one time payment for 1 432 EDUs resulting in Capacity Charge revenue </br>of $5.9 million from the City’s General Fund in connection with the City’s Convention Center dewatering project. </br> The City Council reviews capacity charges on a periodic basis. In June 1996  in response </br>to a request by the City Manager to reduce sewer capacity charges in order to stimulate </br></br>economic development and affordable housing  the City Council approved  retroactive to April </br></br>22  1996  a 64% reduction of sewer capacity charges. On June 8  2004  the City Council </br></br>adopted a revised rate structure based on a full cost recovery analysis which increased the </br></br>sewer capacity charge effective July 1  2004 to $3 710 per unit  which was a 48% increase from </br></br>the then existing sewer capacity charge.  </br> </br>Pursuant to State Water Board guidelines and City policy  the City must use a fair and </br>equitable apportioning of costs based on each user class’ contributions of flow and strength of </br></br>wastewater pollutants discharged. The Participating Agencies are billed based on their </br></br>contribution of flow  TSS and COD per the terms outlined in the respective service contracts  </br></br>which were reviewed and approved by the State Water Board in 1998. In calendar year 2003  </br></br>the City commissioned a cost of service study to design a system of user charges for the City’s </br></br>wastewater service consistent with the State Water Board’s revenue guidelines and City </br></br>policies. This study indicated that changes to the City’s existing sewer capacity charge for </br></br>single family residential customers and multifamily customers in the magnitude of the July 1  </br></br>2004 sewer capacity charge increase referenced above would be required to fully recover the </br></br>costs associated with providing additional facility capacity to new users and existing users </br></br>requiring additional capacity. In October 2006  the City commissioned an additional ut</br>ility </br>cost of service study and rate design study for the Department in order to review revenue </br></br>requirements and cost of service allocations  and to confirm that the City’s system of user </br></br>charges for the City’s wastewater service remained consistent with the State Water Board’s </br></br>revenue guidelines and City policies. The resulting report estimated a full cost recovery </br></br>capacity fee of $4 124 per EDU. On February 26  2007  the City Council adopted a revised rate </br></br>structure based on a full cost recovery analysis which increased the sewer capacity charge </br></br>effective May 1  2007 to $4 124  which is an 11% increase from the prior sewer capacity charge.  </br>  54  </br>Table 12 below summarizes the rate history of sewer capacity charges since July 1  </br>1991. </br> TABLE 12 </br>RATE HISTORY FOR SEWER CAPACITY CHARGES </br> Effective Date </br>Sewer Capacity  </br>Charges  Per Unit  </br>% Change </br>July 1  1991 </br>$4 484 </br>16% July 1  1992 </br>$5 201 </br>16 July 1  1993 </br>$6 033 </br>16 July 1  1994 </br>$6 998 </br>16 April 22  1996</br> 1  </br>$2 500  64  </br>July 1  2004</br> 2  </br>$3 710 48 </br>May 1  2007</br> 3  </br>$4 124 11 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department  City of San Diego. </br> 1  Capacity charge decreases to $2 500 pursuant to City Council Resolution No. R 287543 to encourage building </br>activity. </br> 2  Capacity charge increases to $3 710 pursuant to City Council Resolution No. R 299321 based on results of the </br>Cost of Service Study. </br> 3  Capacity charge increases to $4 124 pursuant to City Council Resolution No. R 302378 dated February 26  2007 </br>based on results of the Cost of Service Study. </br> Table 13 below sets forth the projected capacity charges for the Fiscal Years 2010 </br>through 2014.

Certain of the </br>following information in connection with the financial condition and results of operations of the </br></br>City Sewer Revenue Fund for Fiscal Year 2009 is unaudited and should be read in conjunction </br></br>with certain of the information contained in APPENDIX A—BASIC FINANCIAL </br></br>STATEMENTS  REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND CERTAIN </br></br>EXCERPTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY </br></br>OF SAN DIEGO FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009 ” and  specifically  the </br></br>portion of the basic financial statements relating to the operation of the Sewer Revenue Fund.  </br> </br>Operating Revenues</br>. Total operating revenues for Fiscal Year 2009 were $322.6 m</br>illion  </br>which represented a decrease of $5.5 million from total operating revenues in Fiscal Year </br>2008. </br></br>The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in treatment plant services for others of $23 </br></br>million for prior year refunds and reduced billings  offset by an increase in service charge </br></br>revenues of $16.5 m</br>illion. </br> </br>Operating Expenses</br>. Total operating expenses for Fiscal Year 2009 were $267.3 m</br>illion  a </br>decrease of $5.5 million from Fiscal Year </br>2008. Such decrease was the combined result of a </br>decrease in administrative expenses of $19.9 m</br>illion  an increase in maintenance and </br>operations of $9.0 million  and an increase in depreciation of $5.4 million. Administrative </br></br>expenses during Fiscal Year 2009 include long range strategic planning  policy  information </br></br>systems  and general and administrative expenses. Such expenses represented 27% of total </br></br>operating expenses. </br> </br>Maintenance and Operations expenses include expenses for three treatment plants  two </br>of which are water reclamation plants  and a biosolids center. Operation and Maintenance </br></br>costs were 45% of Operating Expenses and totaled $119.5 m</br>illion for Fiscal Year </br>2009. This </br>increase of $9.0 million was 8% greater than the corresponding amount for Fiscal Year </br>2008  </br>due to reclassifying approximately $5 million of administrative expenses  and approximately </br></br>$3 million of increased chemical expenses due to new regulations at the Point Loma </br></br>Wastewater Treatment Plant. </br> </br>Non Operating Revenues</br>. Non operating revenues for Fiscal Year 2009 decreased by $3.6 </br>million from non operating revenues received in Fiscal Year </br>2008. This decrease was primarily </br>due to a decrease in interest earnings of $4.3 million  and an increase in other revenue of $.7 </br></br>million. </br> </br>Non Operating Expenses</br>. Non operating expenses decreased by $1.0 million to </br>$49.7 </br>million during Fiscal Year </br>2009. The decrease was due to a $1.5 m</br>illion increase in losses </br>attributable to the sale or retirement of capital assets and a decrease in debt service interest </br></br>expense of $2.4 million. </br> </br>Reserves</br>. As of June 30  2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had total reserves of </br>$81.1 m</br>illion  </br>which included the amounts in the Rate Stabilization Fund  Operating Reserve  Appropriated </br></br>Reserve  Dedicated Reserve for Efficiency and Savings  the “DRES”  and Wastewater System </br></br>Capital Improvement Program Reserve. As of January 31  2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had </br>total reserves of $85.3 m</br>illion. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—</br>Rate Stabilization Fund and Other Reserves.” </br> </br>Outstanding Obligations</br>. As of June 30  2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had outstanding </br>Obligations in the principal amount of $1.339 b</br>illion. Following the issuance of the Series </br>2010A Bonds  the Department w</br>ill have outstanding Obligations in the principal amount of </br>$1 319 441 099. See “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE SERIES 2010A </br> 57  </br>BONDS—Outstanding Obligations” and APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009 ” including certain information regarding the </br></br>Department’s debt service coverage ratio requirements. </br> Rate Stabilization Fund and Other Reserves </br></br> The City has established accounts within the Sewer Utility Fund for five reserve funds: </br>the Rate Stabilization Fund  “Rate Stabilization Fund”   the Operating Reserve  “Operating </br></br>Reserve”   the Wastewater System Capital Improvement Program Reserve  “Capital </br></br>Improvement Reserve”   the Appropriated Reserve  “Appropriated Reserve”  and the DRES. </br></br>The Department operates these reserve funds in accordance with the City’s fiscal reserve policy </br></br> the “Fiscal Reserve Policy” . The City’s goals with respect to the Fiscal Reserve Policy are to </br></br>provide adequate cash balances to ensure that the City meets its cash flow obligations  </br></br>maximizes earnings on investments  minimizes borrowing costs and maintains the highest </br></br>credit on its bonds and financial obligations. In the event amounts contained in a particular </br></br>reserve are below the anticipated reserve level as stated in the Reserve Policy  the Mayor is to </br></br>propose a plan as part of the budget for the subsequent fiscal year to replenish such reserve in </br></br>a reasonable timeframe. As of the Fiscal Year 2009  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had total reserves </br>of $81.1 m</br>illion. As of January 31  </br>2010  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund had total reserves of </br>$85.3 </br>million. </br> </br>The Rate Stabilization Fund is funded from operating revenues and serves as a source </br>of funds used to mitigate future rate increases. The Department expects the Rate Stabilization </br></br>Fund to be maintained at a level equal to 20% of Net System Revenues less operating and non </br></br>operating expenses or $21.3 m</br>illion. As of June 30  </br>2009  the balance was $19.3 m</br>illion  which </br>met the incremental target balance for Fiscal Year 2009. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund requested a $2 </br>million increase to the fund on January 20  </br>2010  to attain the targeted $21.3 m</br>illion by Fiscal </br>Year 2010. The use of amounts in the Rate Stab</br>ilization Fund does not require City Council </br>action. However  the Rate Stabilization Fund may only be used upon the recommendation of </br></br>the Department and approval of the Chief Financial Officer and must be used in a manner </br></br>consistent with the Installment Purchase Agreement. </br> </br>The Operating Reserve  which is a subset of cash on hand  is restricted for use in the </br>event an emergency situation resulting in a loss of revenue occurs and prevents the Wastewater </br></br>System from operating in its normal course of business. Amounts so used from the Operating </br></br>Reserve must be replenished no later than the subsequent fiscal year. The Operating Reserve is </br></br>calculated based on the annual operating budget for the fiscal year. The current Operating </br></br>Reserve for Fiscal Year 2010 is 50 days of the budget for Maintenance and Operations costs  </br></br>which is $33.7 m</br>illion. As of June 30  </br>2009  there was approximately $31.7 m</br>illion in the </br>Operating Reserve. As of January 31  2010  the Operating Reserve was $33.7 m</br>illion. The </br>Operating Reserve is expected to increase to 70 days of the budget for Maintenance and </br></br>Operation costs by Fiscal Year 2013  which is projected to be approximately $48.4 m</br>illion. </br> </br>The Department funded the Capital Improvement Reserve  which may only be used for </br>costs of the Wastewater System CIP  in the amount of $5.0 million for Fiscal Year </br>2009. City </br>Council action is required for any withdrawal from the Capital Improvement Reserve. As of </br></br>January 31  2010  approximately $5.0 mi</br>llion remained in the Capital Improvement Reserve. </br> </br>The Appropriated Reserve is budgeted annually for unanticipated expenditures. It may </br>be used to fund operating or capital requirements. If the Appropriated Reserve is used to fund </br></br>unanticipated operating expenses  the approval of the Director of the Public Works </br></br>Department is required and  if the Appropriated Reserve is to be used for unanticipated </br> 58  </br>capital needs  City Council action in the form of an ordinance is required. The Appropriated </br>Reserve was $3.4 million at the end of Fiscal Year </br>2009. As of January 31  2010  there was $3.5 </br>million in the Appropriated Reserve. </br> </br>In Fiscal Year 2008  the City established the DRES to save funds obtained by increasing </br>efficiencies  changing priorities or other actions related to reducing costs of the Wastewater </br></br>System CIP or operations and maintenance of the Wastewater System. The 2008 IROC Report </br></br>recommended that savings from the Sewer Utility Fund be transferred into the DRES in order </br></br>to improve accountability with respect to such savings and to provide funding of the </br></br>Wastewater System in future years in lieu of rate increases. The funds in the DRES may be </br></br>used for accelerating Wastewater System CIP project schedules and reducing the need for </br></br>future rate increases. At the end of each fiscal year  any savings not required for compliance </br></br>with established reserve policies will be transferred into the DRES. At the end of four years  </br></br>any funds transferred into the DRES and not used for capital improvements will be used to </br></br>lower future rates for the Wastewater System. As of June 30  2009  approximately $21.8 </br></br>million was on deposit in the DRES. As of January 31  </br>2010  $21.8 m</br>illion remained on deposit </br>in the DRES.  </br> </br>Table 15 below sets forth the amounts in the several reserves in the Sewer Revenue Fund </br>as of June 30  2009. </br> TABLE 15 </br>SEWER UTILITY FUND RESERVES </br> as of June 30  2009  </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Fund </br>Reserve Amount </br>Rate Stabilization Fund </br>$19 300 </br>Operating Reserve </br>31 653 </br>Capital Improvement Reserve </br>5 000 </br>Appropriated Reserve </br>3 394 </br>Dedicated Reserve for Efficiencies and Savings </br>21 792 </br>   Total </br>$81 139 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department and Comptroller’s Office  City of San Diego. </br>  59  </br>Historical Debt Service Coverage </br> Table 16 below sets forth the total revenues of the Wastewater System  the maintenance </br>and operation costs of the Wastewater System and the resulting debt service coverage for the </br></br>Outstanding Parity Obligations for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 16 </br>CALCULATION OF HISTORIC SENIOR AND AGGREGATE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE </br> $ In Thousands  </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009 </br> Unaudited  </br>   Total </br>Maintenance </br>and  </br> Senior Debt Service </br>All Obligations</br> 1 </br> Fiscal </br>Year </br>Ended </br>June 30 </br>System </br>Revenues </br>Operations </br>Costs of the </br>Wastewater </br>System </br>Net </br>System </br>Revenues </br>Principal </br>Interest </br>Total </br>Debt </br>Service </br>Coverage </br>Total </br>Debt </br>Service </br>Aggregate </br>Debt </br>Service </br>Coverage </br>2005 322 542 204 163 118 379 26 120 50 935 77 055 1.54 84 789 1.40 </br>2006 320 288 202 111 118 177 27 390 49 662 77 052 1.53 86 802 1.36 </br>2007 343 921 202 632 141 289 28 760 48 291 77 051 1.83 96 408 1.47 </br>2008 361 511 211 449 150 062 30 250 46 805 77 055 1.95 94 555 1.59 </br></br>2009 353 446 197 379 156 067 31 700 45 356 77 056 2.03 94 305 1.65 </br>    Source: Statistical section  unaudited  of the Fiscal Year 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.  </br></br> 1  All Obligations include Parity Obligations  Subordinated Obligations and the Existing SRF Loans. </br> Financial Projections </br> Table 17 below sets forth the financial forecast for Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014. </br>Table 17 incorporates certain assumptions  including assumed inflation and interest rates  rate </br></br>increases and the amount of indebtedness to be issued during this period adopted by the </br></br>Department.

Revenues </br>consists of sewer service charges  sewer treatment plant services  services to others  sale of power from </br>cogeneration  contributions in aid  and other miscellaneous sources. Net Revenues assume a 4% annual rate </br>increase to Sewer Service Charges in 2012  2013 and 2014. Net Revenues in 2011 include a one time expected </br>payment from the City of El Cajon for its proportionate share of past capital improvement expenditures. This </br></br>revenue is classified as “Contributions In Aid.” Maintenance and Operation Costs are inflated at 4% each year  </br>excluding personnel expenses </br> 2  Excludes amounts in the Acquisition Fund. </br> 3  The amounts for each of the Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014 assume an approximate average annual 1% EDU </br>growth rate over each of the four fiscal years.

The City has five  5  labor organizations which represent classified employees. </br>They are the International Association of Firefighters Local 145  the Police Officers Association  </br></br>the Municipal Employees Association  the American Federation of State  County  and </br></br>Municipal Employees Local 127  and the California Teamsters Local 911 who represent </br> 61  </br>lifeguards. A sixth labor organization  the Deputy City Attorneys Association represents </br>unclassified deputy city attorneys.  </br> </br>As of January 26  2010  there were 827.5 regular full time wastewater employees of the </br>Department  of which 461 are represented by the Municipal Employees Association  “MEA”  </br></br>and 329 are represented by American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  </br></br>AFL CIO  Local 127  “AFSCME Local 127” . The remaining 37.5 employees are </br></br>unrepresented. The two bargaining units represent approximately 95% of the Department’s </br></br>employees. </br> </br>Contracts for Fiscal Year 2010 and 2011</br>. On April 14  2009  the City Council unanimously </br>approved the terms of the labor agreements for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 for the MEA  the </br></br>International Association of Firefighters Local 145  “IAFF Local 145”  and DCAA. </br></br>Negotiations with the remaining two bargaining units  AFSCME Local 127 and the Police </br></br>Officers Association  “POA”   did not end in agreement. The City Council imposed on both </br></br>unions the terms and conditions of employment contained in the Mayor’s last  best and final </br></br>offer for Fiscal Year 2010. Pursuant to the labor agreements for the bargaining units and the </br></br>terms and conditions approved for AFSCME Local 127 and POA  all five bargaining units and </br></br>the City’s unclassified and unrepresented employees will be held to a general salary freeze and </br></br>subject to a 6% reduction in overall compensation which has been implemented through salary </br></br>reductions  decreases in the City paid allotment of the employee share for employee health </br></br>care  retirement and other employment benefits  fewer paid holidays and mandatory </br></br>furloughs. Each bargaining unit reached the 6% target through a different combination of these </br></br>measures. The compensation reductions also apply to management and unrepresented City </br></br>employees  including the Mayor  his staff  and some independent departments. Departments </br></br>not under Mayoral control including some City Council offices did not participate in some or </br></br>all of the compensation reductions. </br> </br>The City is currently engaged in contract negotiations for Fiscal Year 2011 with the </br>POA  AFSCME Local 127  and the California Teamsters Local 911. Negotiations are ongoing </br></br>with a target date for completion being April 15  2010. </br> </br>Pension Benefit Agreement</br>. On July 28  2008  the City Council ratified an agreement </br>regarding the creation of new pension benefits for non safety City employees with MEA  </br></br>AFSCME Local 127 and DCAA  the “New Pension Plan” . The City expects to save on its </br></br>pension costs over time as new hires are included under the New Pension Plan. The New </br></br>Pension Plan became effective on July 1  2009 and applies to non safety employees hired on or </br></br>after the effective date. The New Pension Plan lowers the defined benefit factor at age 55 and </br></br>60 from 2.50% to 1.00% and from 2.55% to 2.00%  respectively  and modifies the benefit </br></br>formula  which currently permits retirees to receive up to 90.00% of their highest one year </br></br>salary  by limiting compensation available under the pension plan to 80.00% of the highest </br></br>three years average of compensation. In addition  the New Pension Plan establishes a retiree </br></br>medical trust into which both the City and employees will equally contribute 0.25% of salary </br></br>and establishes a new defined contribution component in addition to the defined benefit </br></br>component. The New Pension Plan includes mandatory employee contributions of 1.00% of </br></br>salary  with a City match component. See Note 12 to the City’s Fiscal Year 2009 audited </br></br>financial statements attached hereto as APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  </br></br>REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND CERTAIN EXCERPTS FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30  2009.” </br>  62  </br>Insurance and Liability Claims </br> The Department is self insured for workers’ compensation and long term disability and </br>for public liability claims exposure up to $5 million per occurrence. For liability between $5 </br></br>million and </br>$50 million  the Department is covered by the City  which purchases insurance in </br>collaboration with the California State Association of Counties—Excess Insurance Authority  a </br></br>statewide joint powers authority risk pool  in layers for its public liability exposure. </br> </br>The City participates in the joint purchase of property insurance and flood insurance </br>through the CSAC EIA pool which includes flood and earthquake coverage for scheduled </br></br>locations  including bond financed locations of the Wastewater System. This joint purchase of </br></br>the City’s “all risk” property insurance  insuring approximately $2.73 billion of City property  </br></br>provides coverage for loss to City property under the primary policy up to approximately $25 </br></br>million per occurrence  with a </br>$25 000 deductible. Depending on availab</br>ility and affordability </br>of earthquake insurance  the City may elect not to purchase such coverage in the future. The </br></br>City does not maintain any casualty insurance on the pipelines of the Wastewater System </br></br>because such insurance is not commercially available. </br> </br>Table 18 below sets forth the accrued estimated liabilities and expenditures for liability </br>claims of the Wastewater System for Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 18 </br>LIABILITY CLAIMS BUDGETED AND EXPENDITURES </br>Fiscal Years 2005 to 2009 </br> Unaudited  </br> Fiscal Year </br>Budgeted Liabilities </br>Expenditures</br> 1 </br> 2005 $2 589 000 $1 814 378 </br>2006 2 589 000 500 928 </br></br>2007 2 589 000 1 052 219 </br>2008 1 283 412 1 612 392 </br>2009 1 283 412 884 769 </br>    Source: Public Utilities Department and Risk Management Department  City of San Diego. </br></br> 1  Over budget expenditures are paid from Sewer Revenue Fund balance available for appropriation. </br> Investment of Funds </br> General</br>. Amounts in the funds and accounts of the Sewer Revenue Fund are invested by </br>the City Treasurer in the Treasurer’s Pooled Investment Fund  the “City Pool”  described </br></br>below and the City accounts for such amounts separately from other funds of the City. </br> </br>City Pool</br>. In accordance with the Charter of the City and authority granted by the City </br>Council  the City Treasurer is responsible for investing the unexpended cash in the City Pool. </br></br>Responsibility for the daily investment of funds in the City Pool is delegated to the City’s Chief </br></br>Investment Officer. The City and certain related entities are the only participants in the City </br></br>Pool; there are no other City Pool participants either voluntary or involuntary in the City Pool. </br></br>The investment objectives of the City Pool are preservation of capital  liquidity and return. </br> </br>Oversight and Reporting Requirements</br>. The City Treasurer provides an investment report </br>on a monthly basis to the Chief Financial Officer  the City Comptroller and the City Council </br></br>and annually presents the Investment Policy to the Chief Financial Officer  the Investment </br></br>Advisory Committee and the City Council. The Investment Advisory Committee is comprised </br></br>of two City employees  currently the Chief Financial Officer and the Director of Debt </br></br>Management  and three investment professionals from the private sector and is charged with </br> 63  </br>overseeing the review of the City’s Investment Policy and practices of the City Treasurer and </br>recommending changes thereto. Investments in the City Pool are audited annually by an </br></br>independent firm of certified public accountants as part of the overall audit of the City’s </br></br>financial statements. </br> </br>The City’s investments division uses outside services to provide investment portfolio </br>valuations and accounting and reporting services. These services provide monthly portfolio </br></br>valuation  investment performance statistics  and other portfolio reports that are distributed to </br></br>the Office of the City Treasurer accounting section and the Office of the Comptroller of the </br></br>City for review and reconciliation. The Office of the City Treasurer’s accounting section </br></br>prepares a series of monthly reports  including the portfolio market valuation  and distributes </br></br>these to the Mayor  City Council  Chief Financial Officer  and other officials. </br> </br>Authorized Investments</br>. Investments in the City Pool are governed by State law and </br>further restricted by the City’s Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is prepared with </br></br>safety of principal being the foremost objective. Permitted investments include U.S. Treasury </br></br>securities  U.S. Agency securities  U.S. Agency mortgage backed securities  corporate medium </br></br>term notes  money market instruments  non negotiable FDIC insured certificates of deposit </br></br>and the Local Agency Investment Fund  California State Pool . Reverse repurchase agreements </br></br> “reverse repos”  are restricted to 20% of the base value of the portfolio and are governed by </br></br>various maturity restrictions as well. The main operating funds of the City are managed in two </br></br>separate portfolios. In its management of the “Liquidity” portfolio  comprising about 35% of </br></br>total funds  the City invests in a variety of debt securities with maturities ranging from one </br></br>day to one year. The remaining 65% of funds are managed in a separate “Core” portfolio that </br></br>consists of a variety of debt securities ranging from one day to five years; performance is </br></br>measured against the Merrill Lynch one  to three year U.S. Treasury Index. The 35% </br></br>Liquidity 65% Core portfolio split serves as a guideline. The actual split may vary due to </br></br>market conditions or other factors. Safety of principal and liquidity are paramount </br></br>considerations in the management of both portfolios. </br> </br>Pool Liquidity and Other Characteristics</br>. The City Pool  including both the “Liquidity” </br>and the “Core” portfolios  is highly liquid. Based on preliminary and unaudited month end </br></br>data as of December 31  2009  approximately 13% of the pool investments mature within 62 </br></br>days  16% within 92 days and 22% within 184 days  34% within 1 year  72% within 2 years  </br></br>99% within 3 years  and 100% within 5 years  on a cumulative basis . As of December 31  </br></br>2009  the Pool had a weighted average maturity of 1.44 years  524 days  and its weighted </br></br>average yield was 1.143%. For purposes of calculating weighted average maturity  the City </br></br>Treasurer treats investments in the State wide Local Agency Investment Fund  California State </br></br>Pool  as maturing within one day. The Liquidity portfolio had a duration of 0.40 years and the </br></br>Core portfolio had a duration of 1.85 years as of December 31  2009. Duration is a measure of </br></br>the price volatility of the portfolio and reflects an estimate of the projected increase or decrease </br></br>in the value of the portfolio based upon a decrease or increase in interest rates. Accordingly  </br></br>the Liquidity portfolio should decrease in market value by 0.40% for every 1% increase in </br></br>market interest rates while the Core portfolio should decrease in market value by 1.85% for </br></br>every 1% increase in market interest rates. The City Pool’s composition is designed with a goal </br></br>of having sufficient liquid funds available to meet disbursement requirements. The </br></br>composition and value of investments under management in the City Pool will vary from time </br></br>to time depending on cash flow needs of the City  maturity or sale of investments  purchase of </br></br>new securities  and fluctuations in interest rates. </br>  64  </br>Table 19 below sets forth the City Pool results at December 31  2009. </br> TABLE 19 </br>CITY OF SAN DIEGO POOLED INVESTMENT FUND </br>at December 31  2009 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Investment Instrument </br>Book Value </br>Fair Value </br>Percent of Total</br> 1 </br> U.S. Treasury Bills and Notes </br>$    </br>926 952 </br>$    927 188 </br>44.96% </br>Federal Agency Securities</br> 2 </br> 753 964 754 388 36.57 </br>Medium Term Notes  Corporate </br> 3 </br> 194 391 195 636 9.43 </br>Money Market Instruments</br> 4 </br> 136 340 136 340 6.62 </br>Local Agency Investment Fund 49 891 </br>49 891 </br>2.42 </br>TOTAL INVESTMENTS </br>$2 061 538 </br>$2 063 443 </br>100.00% </br>    Source: Office of the City Treasurer  City of San Diego.  </br> 1  Based on book value. </br></br> 2  Federal National Mortgage Association  “Fannie Mae”  securities and Federal Home Loan Mortgage </br>Corporation  “Freddie Mac”  securities represent 20.24% and 27.25%  respectively  of total Federal Agency </br></br>Securities  which is approximately 7.40% and 9.97%  respectively  of the City Pool. </br> 3  These notes consist of both fixed and floating interest rate securities.

The challenges posed by the unfunded pension </br>liability are significant and  together with significant costs related to postemployment </br></br>healthcare benefits  pose a threat to the future fiscal health of the City. However  as explained </br></br>below under the caption  “Sewer Utility Fund Share of Contribution to Pension System and </br></br>NPO ” the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the City’s annual required contributions </br></br>to the Pension System is approximately 4.95%  equal to approximately $7.6 million  assuming </br></br>a City pension payment of $154.2 m</br>illion  for Fiscal Year </br>2010. Estimates of the Sewer Ut</br>ility </br>Fund’s share of the City’s annual contributions of approximately $14.4 m</br>illion for each of </br>Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 were included in the 2007 Rate Case model that served as the </br></br>basis for the annual rate increases in effect through Fiscal Year 2011 that were approved by the </br></br>City Council. For Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010  the actual contributions required from the Sewer </br></br>Utility Fund were less than the amounts that were assumed in the </br>2007 Rate Case model.  </br> </br>The City’s annual required contribution  “ARC”  payment for Fiscal Year 2011 w</br>ill be </br>$231.7 m</br>illion if paid on July 1  </br>2010. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s expected proportionate share </br>of the ARC payment is 7.08%  which would result in a contribution by the Sewer Utility Fund </br></br>of approximately $16.4 m</br>illion for Fiscal Year </br>2011. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s proportionate </br>share is increasing in Fiscal Year 2011 primarily due to a Department reorganization which </br></br>resulted in budgeted positions being moved from the Water Utility Fund to the Sewer Utility </br></br>Fund. These positions were previously fully captured as a non personnel expense in a service </br></br>level agreement between the two funds. This reorganization of positions will have no material </br></br>impact on the Fiscal Year 2011 operations and maintenance budget for the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund. </br> </br>The amounts and percentages set forth under this caption relating to the City’s Pension </br>System  including  for example  actuarial accrued liabilities and funded ratios  are based upon </br> 65  </br>numerous demographic and economic assumptions  including investment return rates  </br>inflation rates  salary increase rates  cost of living adjustments  postemployment mortality  </br></br>active member mortality  and rates of retirement. The prospective purchasers of the Series </br></br>2010A Bonds are cautioned to review and carefully assess the reasonableness of the </br></br>assumptions set forth in the documents that are cited as the sources for the information under </br></br>this caption. In addition  the prospective purchasers of the Series 2010A Bonds are cautioned </br></br>that such sources and the underlying assumptions speak as of their respective dates  and are </br></br>subject to change  any one of which could cause a significant change in the UAAL  as defined </br></br>below . </br> </br>SDCERS is considered part of the City’s financial reporting entity and is included in the </br>City’s CAFR as a pension system trust fund. SDCERS does prepare its own CAFR  the most </br></br>recent of which is for Fiscal Year 2009. </br> </br>UAAL and its Calculation</br>. According to the June 30  2009 Annual Actuarial Valuation of </br>SDCERS  prepared by Cheiron  Inc.  “Cheiron”  dated as of January 8  2010  the “2009 </br></br>Valuation”   the funded ratio  the actuarial value of assets available for benefits to total </br></br>actuarial accrued liability  of the City’s portion of the SDCERS fund</br>1 was 66.5%  and the </br>SDCERS fund had an unfunded actuarial accrued liability  the </br>“UAAL”  of $2.106 b</br>illion. </br>Thus  for every dollar of benefits due  all vested liabilities   SDCERS had $.66 in assets </br></br>available for payment as of June 30  2009. The UAAL is the difference between total </br></br>actuarially accrued liabilities  the </br>“AAL”  which was approximately $6.282 b</br>illion as of June </br>30  2009  and actuarially calculated assets allocated to funding  which was approximately </br></br>$4.175 b</br>illion as of June 30  </br>2009. </br> </br>Global financial markets experienced significant volatility in fiscal year </br>2009 and </br>SDCERS experienced an actuarial investment loss of $811.4 m</br>illion in the City’s plan during </br>that period. According to the City’s June 30  2008 Annual Actuarial Valuation  the “2008 </br></br>Valuation”  and the 2009 Valuation  the actuarial value of assets  City’s portion  as of June </br></br>30  2008 and June 30  2009 were respectively $4.660 b</br>illion and $4.</br>175 billion. The market </br>value of assets  City’s portion  as of June 30  2008 and June 30  2009  as reported in the 2008 </br></br>Valuation and the 2009 Valuation  respectively  were $4.409 b</br>illion and $3.</br>479 billion. A </br>decline in the actuarial value of assets over time will result in an increase to the City’s ARC in </br></br>comparison to the amounts estimated in the Five Year Financial Outlook for Fiscal Years 2010 </br></br>11 through 2014 15; however  the impact on the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund would be expected to be </br>minimal. See the text under the headings “—City Contributions to SDCERS” and “—Sewer </br></br>Utility Fund Share of Contributions to Pension System and NPO” below.  </br> </br>Actuarial Assumptions</br>. The following are the principal actuarial assumptions used by </br>SDCERS’ actuary in preparing the valuation as of June 30  2009: </br> </br>1. Investment Return Rate: 7.75% a year  net of administrative expenses  </br>compounded annually.  </br>2. Inflation Rate: 4.00% a year  compounded annually. </br>3. Interest Credited to Member Contributions: 7.75% compounded annually. </br>4. Salary Increase Rates: Comprised of a 4.00% inflation rate and 0.5% to 8.0% </br>merit component. </br>5. Annual Cost of Living Adjustments: 2.00% per year  compounded annually. </br>                                                       </br> 1 The City participates in SDCERS along with the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority  “Airport </br>Authority”  and the San Diego Unified Port District  “Port District” .  The information herein refers only to the </br>City’s participation in SDCERS and not to the participation of the Airport Authority or the Port District.   </br> 66  </br>6. Additional Assumptions: Additional assumptions were used regarding rates of </br>separation from active membership  post retirement mortality  active member </br>mortality and rates of retirement. </br> </br>“Smoothing” Methodology</br>. In determining the actuarial value of its assets  SDCERS  as </br>permitted by applicable actuarial guidelines  uses an expected value of assets “smoothing” </br></br>methodology to reduce the impact of market volatility on plan assets. The market value of </br></br>assets represents  as of the valuation date  the value of the assets as if they were liquidated on </br></br>that date. The actuarial value of assets is a value that attempts to smooth annual investment </br></br>return performance over multiple years to reduce annual contribution volatility. The actuarial </br></br>value of assets is used to determine SDCERS’ contribution rates for the City. As of June 30  </br></br>2009  the market value of plan assets was $3.479 b</br>illion  and the actuarial value was $4.</br>175 billion. By the smoothing method used in the </br>2009 Valuation  the calculation of the actuarial </br>value of assets at June 30  2009 started with the actuarial value of assets at June 30  2008  </br></br>added to that 100% of the actuarially assumed rate of return  plus the contribution towards </br></br>plan assets  less payments out from plan assets  plus 25% of the difference between the </br></br>expected actuarial value of assets at June 30  2009  using the above calculation  and the </br></br>actual market value of assets at June 30  2009. In no event w</br>ill the actuarial value of assets </br>ever be less than 80% of the market value of assets nor greater than 120% of the market value </br></br>of assets. The impact of this smoothing methodology will vary each year depending upon the </br></br>year’s actual market value compared to the expected value of assets  either as a net gain or a </br></br>net loss. The City expects SDCERS to employ the smoothing method used in the 2009 </br></br>Valuation to valuations for future fiscal years. As a result of the smoothing methodology  even </br></br>a healthy increase in the market value of the SDCERS’ plan assets as of June 30  2010 would </br></br>have a limited impact on improving the fiscal year 2012 ARC. For example  holding all other </br></br>actuarial assumptions constant  an annual investment return of 25% for fiscal year 2010 is </br></br>estimated to result in an ARC of $244.2 m</br>illion on a citywide basis for fiscal year </br>2012  compared to an ARC of $231.7 m</br>illion for fiscal year </br>2011 . This is primarily due to the fact </br>that  because of the smoothing methodology  approximately 45% of fiscal year 2009’s market </br></br>loss has yet to be captured in future ARC calculations and only 25% of any fiscal year </br>2010 gains will be included in the fiscal year </br>2012 ARC calculation. </br> </br>City Contributions to SDCERS</br>. The City’s ARC consists of:  i  the “normal cost ” being </br>the present value of the benefits that SDCERS expects to become payable in the future </br></br>attributable to a current year’s employment  and  ii  payments made to amortize the UAAL. </br></br>SDCERS currently amortizes the UAAL over several different closed periods: the amortization </br></br>of changes in the UAAL due to assumption changes is over 30 years  the amortization of </br></br>changes in the UAAL due to benefit changes is over five years  the outstanding balance of the </br></br>Fiscal Year 2007 UAAL is amortized over 20 years  such that  as of Fiscal Year 2009  18 years </br></br>of amortization remain   and subsequent yearly gains and losses are amortized over 15 years.  </br></br>Finally  if necessary  there is an additional UAAL cost component to ensure that there is no </br></br>negative amortization in any year  all as approved by the SDCERS Board of Administration in </br></br>its administrative capacity pursuant to its plenary authority over the Pension System. See </br></br>Note 12 to the City’s audited financial statements attached hereto in Appendix A for a </br></br>description of the shorter amortization period prescribed by the City Charter. For several years  </br></br>the City was paying less than the full ARC. The reasons for this are numerous  including prior </br></br>agreements between the City and SDCERS  earnings on pension assets at greater than the </br></br>previous actuarially assumed rate of 8% being credited against contributions  payments </br></br>pursuant to litigation settlements that were mistakenly characterized as “contingent” and </br></br>therefore not made in certain years  and other reasons explained in detail in Note 12 to the </br></br>City’s 2009 audited financial statements. See APPENDIX A—“BASIC FINANCIAL </br></br>STATEMENTS AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FROM THE </br></br>COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR </br></br>FISCAL YEAR 2009” attached hereto. </br> 67  </br> Due to the City’s prior practice of funding the Pension System at less than actuarially </br>required levels  the City has a Net Pension Obligation  “NPO”   which is the cumulative </br></br>difference between the annual pension cost  “Annual Pension Cost”  to the City of the Pension </br></br>System and the actual contribution in a particular year. The Annual Pension Cost is equal to </br></br> i  the ARC   ii  one year’s interest on the NPO  and  iii  an adjustment to the ARC to offset  </br></br>approximately  the amount included in item  i  for amortization of the past contribution </br></br>deficiencies. </br> </br>In Fiscal Year 2009  the City’s total pension payment  including its pension ARC and its </br>contribution for the Preservation of Benefits Plan referenced in the CAFR for Fiscal Year 2009 </br></br> the “Preservation of Benefits Plan”   was $163.6 m</br>illion. The City’s NPO at the end of Fiscal </br>Year 2009 was $177.8 m</br>illion. The City’s pension payment for Fiscal Year </br>2010 is $154.2 </br>million and has been paid in full. The City anticipates contributing an additional $1.4 million </br></br>for the Preservation of Benefits Plan for Fiscal Year 2010. </br> </br>Table 20 below sets forth the City’s portion of SDCERS historical funding progress for </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009. </br> TABLE 20 </br>CITY OF SAN DIEGO </br>Schedule of Funding Progress </br>Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009 </br> $ In Thousands  </br> Unaudited  </br> Valuation Date </br> June 30  </br>Valuation Assets </br>AAL </br>Funded Ratio </br>UAAL 1 </br> 2005 1   2 </br> $2 983 080 $4 436 017 67.25% $1 452 937 </br>2006 1 </br> 3 981 932 4 982 700 79.92 1 000 768 </br>2007 3 </br> 4 413 411 5 597 653 78.84 1 184 242 </br>2008 4 660 346 5 963 550 78.15 1 303 204 </br>2009 4 175 229 6 281 593 66.47 2 106 364 </br>    Source: City of San Diego Comprehensive Annual Financial Report with respect to data for Fiscal Years 2005 </br>through 2008. 2009 Valuation for Fiscal Year 2009. </br> 1  Projected Unit Cost method used for determining actuarial accrued liability. </br> 2  For Fiscal Year 2005  the actuarial accrued liab</br>ility  the </br>UAAL and the funded ratio have been adjusted to </br>reflect the impact of the Corbett contingent settlement benefit. The actuarial valuation provided by the actuary </br></br>for Fiscal Year 2005 does not include this contingent benefit in the funded ratio. However  the valuations </br></br>prepared by the actuary for Fiscal Years 2006 through Fiscal Year 2009 do include the impact of the Corbett </br>contingent settlement benefit. See Note 12 to the CAFR for Fiscal Year 2009 attached hereto as APPENDIX A. </br> 3  Reflects revised actuarial methodologies. The actuarial accrued liability was calculated using the Entry Age </br>Normal method beginning in Fiscal Year 2007. Prior to Fiscal Year 2007  the Projected Unit Cost method was </br></br>used. </br> Sewer Utility Fund Share of Contribution to Pension System and NPO</br>. For Fiscal Year 2009  </br>the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share to fully fund the City’s contribution to the </br></br>pension system was $7.6 million  and for Fiscal Year </br>2010 such share is $7.6 m</br>illion. The Sewer </br>Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case projection  which was the basis for the sewage service charge </br>increases set forth in Table 9 and approved by the City Council  see “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Establishment  Calculation and Collection of Sewer Service </br></br>Charge Revenue and Treatment Plant Services Revenue” and “—Calculation and Collection of </br></br>Capacity Charges”   included $14.4 m</br>illion as the Sewer Utility Fund’s estimated annual </br>proportionate share of the City’s ARC for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011. The City expects </br></br>that the $57.6 m</br>illion total estimate included in the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case </br>projection for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 w</br>ill be sufficient to pay the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br> 68  </br>proportionate share to fully fund the City’s contribution to the Pension System for such years. </br>The Sewer Utility Fund’s share of the NPO at June 30  2009  is approximately $10.8 m</br>illion. </br>See the City’s Fiscal Year 2009 audited financial statements attached hereto  line item entitled </br></br>“Non Current Liabilities Net Pension Obligation” under the table entitled “Proprietary Funds </br></br>Statement of Net Assets.” </br> </br>The following Table 21 sets forth  for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011  the City’s total </br>pension contributions  including its core pension contribution and the Preservation of Benefits </br></br> POB  Plan contribution   the pension contributions included in the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case projection and the corresponding actual  budgeted or projected contributions  which </br></br>have been lower than the 2007 rate case projections in total for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 </br></br> 2007 rate case projections are from 2008 through 2011 . </br> TABLE 21 </br>CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND SEWER UTILITY FUND </br>PENSION CONTRIBUTION </br>Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 </br> $ In Millions  </br>Fiscal Year  </br>ending June 30 </br>  ARC 1 </br> Total City  </br>Pension Contribution</br> 2 </br> Department Rate  </br>Case Projection</br> 3 </br> Actual  </br>Budgeted Projected</br> 2 </br> 2008 $140.1 $166.6</br> 4 </br> $14.4 $10.2</br> 5 </br> 2009 165.7 163.6</br> 4 </br> 14.4 7.6</br> 5 </br> 2010 155.2 155.6</br>  4 </br> 14.4 </br> 7.6</br> 6 </br> 2011 231.7</br> 7 </br> 233.2</br>  4 </br> 14.4 16.4</br>  6 </br>     Source: The City of San Diego Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year ended June 30  2008 and </br>June 30  2009; City of San Diego Financial Management Department and the Public Ut</br>ilities Department. </br> 1 </br> Includes core pension ARC and POB Plan ARC.

FY </br>2009: Includes </br>$161.7 m</br>illion core pension contribution per SDCERS June 30  </br>2007 Actuarial Valuation  $1.2 m</br>illion POB Plan </br>contribution  and $700 000 in additional voluntary contributions. FY 2010: Includes $154.2 m</br>illion core pension </br>contribution per SDCERS June 30  2008 Actuarial Valuation and a budgeted $1.4 m</br>illion POB Plan contribution. </br>FY 2011: Includes the core pension contribution per SDCERS June 30  2009 Actuarial Valuation and a projected </br></br>$1.5 million POB Plan contribution. </br> 5 </br> Actual. The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share to fully fund the City’s pension contribution  excluding </br>contributions for the POB Plan   was 6.16% for Fiscal Year 2008 and 4.68% for Fiscal Year 2009. The Department </br>contributes to the POB Plan only if its employees receive benefits thereunder. The Department was not required to </br></br>contribute to the POB Plan in Fiscal Year 2008 or 2009. The Department’s contribution to the POB  if any  for </br>subsequent Fiscal Years will be determined at the end of the respective fiscal years. See footnote  6  below for a </br>discussion of adjustments to the proportionate share. </br> 6 </br> Fiscal Year 2010 budgeted amount and Fiscal Year 2011 projected amount  assuming the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s </br>proportionate share to fully fund the City’s pension contribution  excluding contributions for the POB Plan   is </br></br>4.95% and 7.08%  respectively. The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share is established at the beginning of a </br></br>Fiscal Year and may increase or decrease during the year and from year to year depending on a variety of </br>factors  including the number of covered employees attributable to the Sewer Utility Fund  the retirement benefits </br>accruing to such employees and end of the year payroll adjustments.   </br> 7 </br> The POB Plan ARC has not yet been determined for FY 2011 and  accordingly  has not been included. </br> Actual and budgeted amounts set forth above reflect amounts necessary for the City to </br>satisfy its pension contribution requirement for each fiscal year and may be more or less than </br></br>the amounts projected in the 2007 Rate Case. To date  amounts included in the Sewer Ut</br>ility </br>Fund’s 2007 Rate Case for Fiscal Years 2008 2011 have in total exceeded the amounts actually </br></br>required to satisfy the Sewer Utility Fund’s pension contribution requirement.  </br>  69  </br>In addition to the City’s ARC payment  the City has entered into a court approved </br>class action settlement in the case of </br>William J. McGuigan v. City of San Diego  et. al.</br>  that </br>requires the City to make a payment of the remaining settlement amount of approximately </br>$32.8 m</br>illion plus any interest accrued under the settlement to SDCERS by June 8  </br>2011. Due </br>to the unreasonable hardship that would result if the City were required to make this payment </br></br>within the proscribed time period  the City will seek to modify the settlement agreement to </br></br>allow the City to pay the remaining settlement amount over four years. The modified </br></br>settlement  if approved by the Court  would not significantly affect the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br></br>payment of its proportionate share of the McGuigan settlement. If the modified settlement is </br></br>approved  the Sewer Utility Fund’s payment would be approximately $2.3 million if made on </br></br>the expected payment date of June 30  2010. If the settlement is not modified  the Sewer </br></br>Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the payment would be would be approximately $2.4 </br></br>million if paid on June 8  </br>2011. This lawsuit involved the underfunding of the pension system </br></br>by the City and all payments made under the settlement are credited against the UAAL. </br> Postemployment Healthcare Benefits </br></br> The City provides retiree healthcare benefits  also known as other postemployment </br>benefits  “OPEB”   to certain health eligible retired employees through a plan administered by </br></br>SDCERS. The City’s OPEB plan includes approximately 5 400 retirees  8 900 active employees </br></br>and 600 terminated vested members as of June 30  2009. Historically  OPEB expenses were </br></br>funded on a pay as you go basis. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2008  the City entered into an </br></br>agreement with the California Public Employees Retirement System  “CalPERS”  as a </br></br>participating employer in the CalPERS Employers Retirement Benefits Trust  “CERBT”  to </br></br>pre fund future OPEB expenses. In fiscal year 2009  the City contributed approximately $25.6 </br></br>million to SDCERS to pay current OPEB expenses and contributed an additional amount of </br></br>approximately $23.9 m</br>illion to the CERBT. In fiscal year </br>2010  the City budgeted </br>approximately $32.1 m</br>illion to SDCERS to pay current OPEB expenses and budgeted an </br>additional contribution of approximately $25 m</br>illion to the CERBT. As of December 31  </br>2009  </br>the balance in the CERBT was approximately $50.3 m</br>illion. </br> </br>The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the City’s pay as you go contribution </br>for OPEB was approximately $2.0 million for Fiscal Year </br>2009. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s </br>proportionate share of the contribution to CERBT was approximately $1.9 million. For Fiscal </br></br>Year 2010  the Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund is budgeted to contribute approximately $2.5 million and $2 </br>million  respectively  as its proportionate share of the City’s pay as you go OPEB contribution </br></br>and the CERBT contribution. </br> </br>As of the date of this Official Statement  the City has not fully funded its ARC for </br>OPEB  i.e.  the sum of the normal cost of the postemployment benefits plus amortization of </br></br>the OPEB UAAL . The City has not projected the amounts necessary to fully fund its OPEB </br></br>ARC payments beyond the amounts set forth in its October 2009 Five Year Financial Outlook </br></br>and does not expect to fully fund its OPEB ARC payment in that timeframe  as outlined in the </br></br>October 2009 Five Year Financial Outlook. All future contributions for postemployment </br></br>healthcare benefits will be credited toward the City’s ARC for retiree healthcare liabilities in </br></br>accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board  “GASB”  Statement No. 43  </br></br>“Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans”  “GASB </br></br>43”   and GASB Statement No. 45  “Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for </br></br>Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions”  “GASB 45” . See Note 13 to the Fiscal Year </br></br>2009 audited financial statements attached hereto in Appendix A. </br> </br>In connection with compliance with GASB 43 and GASB 45  the City has calculated its </br>net OPEB obligation  “NOPEBO”  as of June 30  2009 to be approximately $93.9 m</br>illion. The </br>NOPEBO is the cumulative difference between the City’s annual OPEB cost and City’s </br> 70  </br>contributions to OPEB in a particular year  including the OPEB liability or asset at transition  if </br>any. Annual OPEB cost is equal to  i  the ARC for OPEB   b  one year’s interest on the </br></br>NOPEBO from prior years  which the City determined to be zero at the beginning of Fiscal </br></br>Year 2008  the transition year  in accordance with GASB 45   and  c  an adjustment to the ARC </br></br>for OPEB to offset the effect of actuarial amortization of past under  or over contributions. </br></br>The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of the City’s NOPEBO as of June 30  </br>2009 was </br>$6.9 million. The City intends to pre fund the CERBT with approximately </br>$25 million on an </br>annual basis  as described in Note 13 to the Fiscal Year 2009 audited financial statements </br></br>attached hereto in Appendix A. </br> </br>An actuarial valuation of the City’s postemployment medical benefit program as of </br>June 30  2009  the “2009 OPEB Valuation”  was performed by Buck Consultants for the </br></br>purpose of determining the City’s annual cost in accordance with GASB 45. The valuation  </br></br>dated September 17  2009  reflected a discount rate of 6.69% based on the City’s actual and </br></br>expected contributions to CERBT  inflation factors for increases in healthcare costs and </br></br>premium costs  and a 30 year amortization period  open basis . According to the 2009 OPEB </br></br>Valuation  using the assumptions described above and consistent with GASB 45  the UAAL </br></br>for OPEB for all retirees  deferred retirement participants  vested terminated and active </br></br>members was $1.32 billion and the ARC for OPEB will be </br>$120.32 m</br>illion for Fiscal Year 2011 </br> as reported in the actuarial valuation dated June 30  2009 . </br> </br>Table 22 below sets forth the retiree health contributions included in the Sewer Utility </br>Fund’s 2007 Rate Case projection for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 and the corresponding </br></br>actual  budgeted or projected amounts  which have been lower than the projected amounts set </br></br>forth in the 2007 Rate Case. Amounts budgeted for future years may be lower than amounts </br></br>set forth in the 2007 Rate Case projection. The City expects that such amount w</br>ill be sufficient </br>to pay the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share to fund the City’s contribution to OPEB </br></br>for such years. Projections sets forth in the Sewer Utility Fund’s </br>2007 Rate Case include </br>amounts through Fiscal Year 2011  years through which sewer rates were approved by the City </br></br>Council.  </br>  71  </br>TABLE 22 </br>WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br>RETIREE HEALTH CONTRIBUTION </br>Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011 </br> $ In Millions  </br> Fiscal Year  </br>ending June 30 </br> ARC </br>Total City </br>Contribution </br>Rate  </br>Case Projection </br>Actual  </br>Budgeted Projected</br> 1 </br> 2008 $ 91.6 $53.6 $4.4 $4.2</br> 2 </br> 2009 104.5 49.5 6.7 3.9</br> 2 </br> 2010 113.4 57.1 9.1 4.5</br> 3  </br> 2011 120.3 62.2 9.1 5.5</br> 4  </br>     Source: The City of San Diego Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year ended June 30  2008 and </br>June 30  2009; City of San Diego Financial Management Department and the Public Ut</br>ilities Department. </br> 1  Consists of the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share of pay as you go postemployment healthcare benefits </br>and its proportionate share of contributions to CalPERS for OPEB. The Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate </br>share of OPEB for Fiscal Year 2008 was 7.84% and for Fiscal Year 2009 was 7.88%. Proposed and projected </br></br>amounts reflect an assumed Sewer Utility Fund proportionate share of 7.96% for Fiscal Year </br>2010 and 8.8% for </br>Fiscal Year 2011. The Sewer Ut</br>ility Fund’s proportionate share may increase or decrease from year to year </br>depending on a variety of factors  including the number of covered employees attributable to the Sewer Utility </br>Fund and the retirement benefits accruing to such employees. </br> 2  Actual. </br></br> 3  Proposed Budget. </br></br> 4  Projected Department contribution based on the Sewer Utility Fund’s proportionate share  see footnote  1  </br>above  of the City’s aggregate pay as you go postemployment healthcare contributions and OPEB contributions </br></br>through CalPERS  as set forth in the June 30  2009 Annual Actuarial Valuation.  </br>  RISK FACTORS </br> </br>The ability of the City to pay principal of and interest on the Series </br>2010A Bonds </br>depends primarily upon the receipt by the City of Net System Revenues. Some of the events </br></br>which could prevent the City from receiving a sufficient amount of Net System Revenues to </br></br>enable it to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2010A Bonds are summarized below. </br></br>The following description of risks is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the risks associated </br></br>with the purchase of the Series 2010A Bonds and the order of the risks set forth below does not </br></br>necessarily reflect the relative importance of the various risks. </br> Limited Obligations </br> </br>The obligation of the City to pay the 2010A Installment Payments securing the Series </br>2010A Bonds is a limited obligation of the City and is not secured by a legal or equitable </br></br>pledge or charge or lien upon any property of the City or any of its income or receipts  except </br></br>the Net System Revenues. The obligation of the City to make the 2010A Installment Payments </br></br>does not constitute an obligation of the City to levy or pledge any form of taxation or for which </br></br>the City has levied or pledged any form of taxation. The City is obligated under the </br></br>Installment Purchase Agreement to make the Installment Payments solely from Net System </br></br>Revenues. </br> </br>No assurance can be made that Net System Revenues  estimated or otherwise  will be </br>realized by the City in amounts sufficient to pay the 2010A Installment Payments. Among </br></br>other matters  drought  general and local economic conditions and changes in law and </br></br>government regulations  including initiatives and moratoriums on growth  could adversely </br></br>affect the amount of Net System Revenues realized by the City. In addition  the realization of </br></br>future Net System Revenues is subject to  among other things  the capabilities of management </br></br>of the City  the ability of the City to provide sewer service to its retail customers and the </br> 72  </br>Participating Agencies  the ability of the City to establish  maintain and collect charges for the </br>Wastewater Service to its retail customers and the Participating Agencies and the ability of the </br></br>City to establish  maintain and collect rates and charges sufficient to pay for Operation and </br></br>Maintenance costs and the 2010A Installment Payments. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Historical Revenues and Expenses.” </br> Wastewater System Expenses and Collections </br></br> The Operation and Maintenance costs of the Wastewater System are expected to </br>increase in the next five years. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—</br></br>Financial Projections.” However  there can be no assurance that the City’s projected future </br></br>Maintenance and Operation costs for the Wastewater System will actually be as projected by </br></br>the Department and described in this Official Statement. In addition  demands on the </br></br>Wastewater System will increase due to population growth and regulatory requirements in the </br></br>future. Further  although the City has covenanted to prescribe  revise and collect rates and </br></br>charges for Wastewater Service in amounts necessary to pay the 2010A Installment Payments  </br></br>there can be no assurance that such amounts will be collected in the amounts and at the times </br></br>necessary to pay the 2010A Installment Payments sufficient to provide for the payment of the </br></br>Series 2010A Bonds. </br> Rate Setting Process Under Proposition 218 </br> </br>Proposition 218  which added Articles X</br>IIIC and XIIID to the California Consti</br>tution  </br>affects the City’s ability to impose f</br>uture rate increases  and no assurance can be given that </br>future rate increases will not encounter majority protest opposition or be challenged by </br></br>initiative action authorized under Proposition 218. During the last two Proposition 218 rate </br></br>increase hearings with respect to the Wastewater System  the Office of the City Clerk received </br></br>approximately 6% of the aggregate protests required to prevent the increase. In the event that </br></br>future proposed rate increases cannot be imposed as a result of majority protest or initiative  </br></br>the City might thereafter be unable to generate Net System Revenues in the amounts required </br></br>by the Installment Purchase Agreement to pay 2010A Installment Payments. Proposition 218 </br></br>also affects the Participating Agencies’ ability to collect sewer service charges and impose </br></br>future rate increases in amounts sufficient to make payments under the Regional Wastewater </br></br>Disposal Agreement and the Transportation Agreements. There can be no assurance that the </br></br>Participating Agencies have complied or will comply with the provisions of Proposition </br>218 or </br>that the Participating Agencies’ ability to impose future rate increases will not be adversely </br></br>affected by majority protests or initiatives. The Participating Agencies are required to pay the </br></br>amounts due under the Regional Wastewater Disposal Agreement regardless of the source of </br></br>payment. However  if the Participating Agencies are unable to pay amounts due and payable </br></br>for any reason  the City’s ability to generate Net System Revenues in the amounts required by </br></br>the Installment Purchase Agreement to pay 2010A Installment Payments could be adversely </br></br>affected. See “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND WASTEWATER RATES </br></br>AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID.” </br> </br>Notwithstanding the foregoing  the City has covenanted to fix  prescribe and collect </br>rates and charges for Wastewater Service at a level at least sufficient to meet its debt </br></br>requirements  as set forth under “SECURITY AND SOURCES OF PAYMENT FOR THE </br></br>SERIES 2010A BONDS—Rate Covenant.” The current sewer rates for customers within the </br></br>City have been approved by the Mayor and the City Council and have been imposed in </br></br>compliance with Proposition 218. See “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND </br></br>WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID.”  </br>  73  </br>Statutory and Regulatory Compliance </br> Claims against the Wastewater System for failure to comply with applicable laws and </br>regulations could be significant. Such claims are payable from assets of the Wastewater </br></br>System or from other legally available sources. In addition to claims by private parties  </br></br>changes in the scope and standards for public agency Wastewater Systems such as that </br></br>operated by the Department may also lead to administrative orders issued by Federal or State </br></br>regulators. Future compliance with such orders can also impose substantial additional costs </br></br>on the Sewer Revenue Fund. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY </br></br>REQUIREMENTS.” No assurance can be given that the cost of compliance with such laws  </br></br>regulations and orders would not adversely affect the ability of the Wastewater System to </br></br>generate Net System Revenues sufficient to pay the 2010A Installment Payments. See </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS—Collection of Sewage ” “– </br></br>Treatment of Sewage” and “—Discharge and Disposal of Sewage.” However  the City has </br></br>covenanted in the Installment Purchase Agreement to fix  prescribe and collect rates and </br></br>charges for the Wastewater System which will yield Net System Revenues for each fiscal year </br></br>sufficient to pay debt service on the Parity Obligations  including the 2010A Installment </br></br>Payments securing the Series 2010A Bonds. All proposed increases for such rates and charges </br></br>for the Wastewater System are subject to the restrictions and requirements of Articles XIIIC </br></br>and XIIID of the California Consti</br>tution. </br> Earthquakes  Wildfires and Other Natural Disasters </br> </br>Although the City has not experienced any significant damage from seismic activities  </br>the geographic area in which the City is located is subject to unpredictable seismic activity. </br></br>Southern California is characterized by a number of geotechnical conditions which represent </br></br>potential safety hazards  including expansive soils and areas of potential liquefaction and </br></br>landslide. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could interrupt operation of the Wastewater </br></br>System and thereby interrupt the ability of the City to realize Net System Revenues sufficient </br></br>to pay the 2010A Installment Payments securing the payment of the Series 2010A Bonds. The </br></br>San Andreas  Rose Canyon  Elsinore and San Jacinto fault zones are all capable of producing </br></br>earthquakes in the San Diego area. In anticipation of such potential disasters  the City designs </br></br>and constructs all facilities of the Wastewater System to the seismic codes in effect at the time </br></br>of design of the project. The Wastewater System has not experienced any significant losses of </br></br>facilities or services as a result of earthquakes. Facilities within the Wastewater System </br></br>generally consist of pipelines and connections  flow control facilities  and pumping stations  </br></br>which are not typically vulnerable to damage by wildfires. All treatment facilities  pumping </br></br>stations and piping structures are designed in accordance with appropriate seismic design </br></br>requirements.  </br> </br>The above ground facilities within the Wastewater System are designed to be tolerant to </br>damage by wildfires through the use of fire resistant material where possible  such as concrete </br></br>and masonry blocks. In addition  the Department works closely with the City’s fire department </br></br>to ensure that proper vegetative clearances are maintained in and around the properties and </br></br>facilities of the Wastewater System. The Department watches for wildfires that may threaten </br></br>the facilities of the Wastewater System and operations and maintenance crews are dispatched </br></br>to ensure that all above ground facilities remain safe and operational. Further  during fires  the </br></br>Department works closely with the City’s fire department and law enforcement officers to </br></br>monitor and protect facilities of the Wastewater System to ensure continuous operation. One </br></br>pump station sustained minor damage from the October 2007 wildfires in San Diego County. </br> </br>Although the City has implemented disaster preparedness plans and made </br>improvements to Wastewater System facilities in connection with such natural disasters  there </br></br>can be no assurance that these or any additional measures will be adequate in the event that a </br> 74  </br>natural disaster occurs  nor that costs of preparedness measures will be as currently </br>anticipated. Further  damage to components of the Wastewater System could cause a material </br></br>increase in costs for repairs or a corresponding material adverse impact on Net System </br></br>Revenues. The City is not obligated under the Installment Purchase Agreement to procure and </br></br>maintain  or cause to be procured and maintained  nor does the City plan to procure and </br></br>maintain  earthquake insurance on the Wastewater System. </br> Risks Relating to the Water Supply </br> </br>The ability of the Wastewater System to operate effectively can be affected by the water </br>supply available to the City  which is situated in an arid and semi desert environment that is </br></br>currently subject to drought conditions. If the water supply decreases significantly  whether by </br></br>operation of mandatory supply restrictions  prohibitively high water costs or otherwise  flow </br></br>within the Wastewater System will diminish and Net System Revenues available to pay the </br></br>2010A Installment Payments may be adversely affected. Under current estimates  Wastewater </br></br>System operations and Net System Revenues are not expected to be materially adversely </br></br>affected if the Department is ordered to conserve up to 20% of its annual water supply  </br></br>receives an unexpectedly low water allocation  or becomes subject to penalties or additional </br></br>expenses because of an inability to meet the conservation goal. Further  the Department </br></br>anticipates that any such reduction in Net System Revenues would be offset in part by </br></br>reductions in the amount of sewage collected and treated by the Department  which would </br></br>reduce operational expenses. </br> Security of the Wastewater System </br> </br>The safety of the Wastewater System within the operational areas of the Department is </br>maintained via a combination of regular inspections by the Department employees  electronic </br></br>monitoring  and analysis of unusual incident reports. All above ground facilities  operated and </br></br>maintained by WWTD  including the Point Loma Plant  the Metropolitan Biosolids Center  the </br></br>North City Plant and South Bay Plant and pumping stations within the Wastewater System  </br></br>are controlled access facilities with fencing  gates  closed circuit television systems and security </br></br>officers at appropriate points. Smaller  above ground and subterranean pumping stations  </br></br>operated and maintained by WWC  are locked with padlock or internal locking mechanisms </br></br>and most are monitored via access intrusion alarms. Security improvements are evaluated on </br></br>an ongoing basis. The electronic operations and controls have been evaluated and exposure </br></br>reduced through a series of technology systems enhancements and integration. </br> </br>Military conflicts and terrorist activities may adversely impact the operations and </br>finances of the Wastewater System. The Department continually plans and prepares for </br></br>emergency situations and immediately responds to ensure sewer services are maintained. </br></br>However  there can be no assurance that any existing or additional safety and security </br></br>measures will prove adequate in the event that terrorist activities are directed against the </br></br>Wastewater System or that costs of security measures will not be greater than presently </br></br>anticipated. Further  damage to certain components of the Wastewater System could require </br></br>the City to increase expenditures for repairs to the Wastewater System significantly enough to </br></br>adversely impact the City’s ability to pay debt service on the Series </br>2010A. The City has </br>established within the Sewer Revenue the Operating Reserve  which is currently funded at a </br></br>minimum of 50 days’ operating costs  to be gradually increased to 70 days of operating costs </br></br>in Fiscal Years 2010 to Fiscal Year 2013 which may be used under certain circumstances for </br></br>repairs to the Wastewater System. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL </br></br>OPERATIONS—Rate Stabilization Fund and Other Funds and Accounts.” </br>  75  </br>Utility Costs </br> No assurance can be given that any future significant reduction or loss of power would </br>not materially adversely affect the operations of the Wastewater System. The volume of </br></br>wastewater conveyed and treated in the Wastewater System on a daily basis requires a </br></br>significant amount of electrical and thermal power. Electricity is needed to run several assets </br></br>including  among other things  pumps  lights  computers  mechanical valves and machinery. </br></br>Thermal energy  usually generated by electrical power or by burning natural gas  provides heat </br></br>and cooling necessary for both buildings and the wastewater treatment process. Energy in </br></br>excess of the amount necessary to power the Metropolitan Biosolids Center reduces the </br></br>amount of energy purchased by the Department from the local power grid for use at facilities </br></br>in the Wastewater System. The Department cannot guarantee that prices for electricity or gas </br></br>will not increase  which could adversely affect the Wastewater System’s financial condition. </br></br>Such increases in sewer rates and such other charges as well as increases in electricity and gas </br></br>costs are eligible to be “passed through” to the City’s sewer customers as increased sewer rates </br></br>in accordance with the City Municipal Code. Such “pass through” rate increases are subject to </br></br>Proposition 218 notice requirements. See “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES </br></br>AND WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID.” </br> </br>The Department operates an energy efficiency program at its facilities as a component </br>of its ongoing commitment to protect the environment by preserving our natural resources  </br></br>reducing power consumption  using renewable energy sources  seeking cheaper sources of </br></br>power and serving the needs of all our customers. Energy savings  if any  directly benefit the </br></br>residents of the City by helping to maintain lower sewer rates while providing renewable </br></br>electric energy to the region. </br> Impact of Current Fiscal Crisis on Wastewater System Revenues </br> </br>Since 2008  the United States financial markets have been experiencing extreme </br>volatility precipitated by major economic disruptions  including a severe economic recession </br></br>and significant credit and liquidity problems. The City cannot predict the extent to which the </br></br>fiscal problems will continue to be encountered in this and in any future Fiscal Years  and  it is </br></br>not clear what additional measures  if any  will be taken by the State or Federal government to </br></br>address the continuing fiscal crisis. Accordingly  the City cannot predict the final outcome of </br></br>future State or Federal actions or the impact that such actions will have on the Wastewater </br></br>System’s finances and operations. </br> </br>Pursuant to the Installment Purchase Agreement  the City is obligated to fix  prescribe </br>and collect rates and charges for Wastewater Service that will be at least sufficient to pay </br></br>during each Fiscal Year all Obligations  other than Parity Obligations  payable in such Fiscal </br></br>Year  and to yield during each Fiscal Year Net System Revenues equal to 120% of Debt Service </br></br> defined generally to mean the aggregate amount of principal  sinking fund payments and </br></br>interest payable in respect of all Parity Obligations for such Fiscal Year . The Installment </br></br>Purchase Agreement also prohibits the City from reducing the rates and charges then in effect </br></br>unless the Net System Revenues from such reduced rates and charges will at all times be </br></br>sufficient to meet the requirements of the Installment Purchase Agreement. Further  the </br></br>Indenture provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default  as </br></br>defined in the Indenture   including nonpayment of principal of or interest on the Series 2010A </br></br>Bonds  the holders of the Series 2010A Bonds may proceed to enforce their beneficial rights by </br></br>mandamus  or other suit  action or proceeding at law or in equity  which includes an action for </br></br>specific performance by the City with respect to its rate covenant and any other agreement </br></br>contained in the Installment Purchase Agreement. See also “RISK FACTORS—Rate Setting </br></br>Process Under Proposition 218” and “CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND </br> 76  </br>WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES—Articles XIIIC and XIIID” for a description of </br>limitations on the rate setting process under the California Constitution. </br> </br>The Department has taken the current fiscal crisis into consideration in its projections of </br>capacity charges for the current and subsequent fiscal years. In Fiscal Year 2009  $10.4 m</br>illion </br>was generated which includes a one time Capacity Charge of $5.9 million from a dewatering </br></br>project at the San Diego Convention Center. The Department projects that $5.0 million will be </br></br>generated in Fiscal Year 2010. The Capacity Charge revenue projections for Fiscal Years 2011 </br></br>and through Fiscal Year 2014 assume an average annual growth rate of approximately 1% in </br></br>EDUs.  </br> </br>The Department has also considered the effects of the housing market on the other </br>components of System Revenues  including revenues generated from sewer service charges. </br></br>Notwithstanding housing foreclosures and related account closings  usage of the Wastewater </br></br>System has remained stable. Accordingly  the Department expects that the current housing </br></br>conditions will not adversely affect the ability of the Wastewater System to generate Net </br></br>System Revenues sufficient to pay the 2010A Installment Payments. However  the City cannot </br></br>predict the extent to which the current or any future financial crisis will impact its ability to </br></br>generate Net System Revenues in the amounts required by the Installment Purchase Agreement </br></br>to pay 2010A Installment Payments. In particular  the City cannot predict the extent to which </br></br>an economic recession and credit crisis will affect f</br>uture wastewater flow  the impact of any </br>reduced demand on the Wastewater System’s finances and operations or whether a sustained </br></br>fiscal crisis would create sufficient pressure on the City to effect a reduction in sewer fees. </br> Acceleration; Limitations on Remedies </br> </br>The Indenture provides that  upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default </br>thereunder  the Trustee may  subject to certain conditions  declare the principal of all Bonds  </br></br>including the Series 2010A Bonds  then Outstanding and the interest accrued thereon to be due </br></br>and payable immediately. The foregoing notwithstanding  the remedy of acceleration is subject </br></br>to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State  including a limitation on </br></br>enforcement obligations against funds needed to serve the public welfare and interest. Also  </br></br>any remedies available to the Owners of the Series 2010A Bonds upon the occurrence of an </br></br>Event of Default under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions </br></br>which are often subject to discretion and delay and could prove both expensive and time </br></br>consuming to obtain. </br> </br>Further  enforceability of the rights and remedies of the Owners of the Series </br>2010A Bonds  and the obligations incurred by the City  may become subject to the Federal bankruptcy </br></br>code and applicable bankruptcy  insolvency  reorganization  moratorium  or similar laws </br></br>relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditor’s rights generally  now or hereafter in effect  </br></br>equity principles which may limit the specific enforcement under State law of certain remedies  </br></br>the exercise by the United States of America of the powers delegated to it by the Constitution  </br></br>the reasonable and necessary exercise  in certain exceptional situations  of the police powers </br></br>inherent in the sovereignty of the State and its governmental bodies in the interest of serving a </br></br>significant and legitimate public purpose  and the limitations on remedies against counties in </br></br>the State. Bankruptcy proceedings  or the exercise of powers by the Federal or State </br></br>government  if initiated  could subject the Owners of the Series 2010A Bonds to judicial </br></br>discretion and interpretation of their rights in bankruptcy or otherwise and consequently may </br></br>entail risks of delay  limitation  or modification of their rights. </br> </br>  77  </br>CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES AND  </br>WASTEWATER RATES AND CHARGES </br> Article XIIIA </br> Article XIIIA of the State Constitution provides that the maximum ad valorem tax on </br>real property cannot exceed 1% of the “full cash value ” which is defined as “the county </br></br>assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975 76 tax b</br>ill under ‘full cash value’ </br>or  thereafter  the appraised value of real property when purchased  newly constructed  or a </br></br>change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment ” subject to exceptions for certain </br></br>circumstances of transfer or reconstruction and except with respect to certain voter approved </br></br>debt. The “full cash value” is subject to annual adjustment to reflect increases  not to exceed </br></br>2% per year  or decreases in the consumer price index or comparable local data  or to reflect </br></br>reduction in property value caused by damage  destruction or other factors. </br> </br>Article XIIIA requires a vote of two thirds of the qualified electorate to impose special </br>taxes  while generally precluding the imposition of any additional ad valorem  sales or </br></br>transaction tax on real property. As amended  Article XIIIA exempts from the 1% tax </br></br>limitation any taxes above that level required to pay debt service on certain voter approved </br></br>general obligation bonds for the acquisition or improvement of real property. In addition  </br></br>Article XIIIA requires the approval of two thirds of all members of the State Legislature to </br></br>change any State laws resulting in increased tax revenues. </br> </br>Under California law  any fee which exceeds the reasonable cost of providing the service </br>for which the fee is charged is a “special tax ” which under Article XIIIA must be authorized </br></br>by a two thirds vote of the electorate. Accordingly  if a portion of the City’s water or sewer </br></br>user rates or Capacity Fees were determined by a court to exceed the reasonable cost of </br></br>providing service  the City would not be permitted to continue to collect that portion unless it </br></br>were authorized to do so by a two thirds majority of the votes cast in an election to authorize </br></br>the collection of that portion of the rates or fees. The reasonable cost of providing wastewater </br></br>services has been determined by the State Controller to include depreciation and allowance for </br></br>the cost of capital improvements. In addition  the California courts have determined that fees </br></br>such as capacity fees will not be special taxes if they approximate the reasonable cost of </br></br>constructing the water or wastewater capital improvements contemplated by the local agency </br></br>imposing the fee. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Historical </br></br>Revenues and Expenses.” </br> Article XIIIB </br> </br>Article XIIIB of the California Constitution limits the annual appropriations of </br>proceeds of taxes by State and local government entities to the amount of appropriations of </br></br>the entity for the prior fiscal year  as adjusted for changes in the cost of living  changes in </br></br>population and changes in services rendered by the entity. User fees and charges are </br></br>considered proceeds of taxes only to the extent they exceed the reasonable costs incurred by a </br></br>governmental entity in supplying the goods and services for which such fees and charges are </br></br>imposed. </br> </br>To the extent that assessments  fee and charges collected by the City are used to pay </br>the costs of maintaining and operating the Wastewater System and payments due on the </br></br>Series 2010A Bonds  including the funding of the Reserve Fund   the City believes that such </br></br>moneys are not subject to the annual appropriations limit of Article XIIIB. </br>  78  </br>Articles XIIIC and XIIID </br> On November 5  1996  the voters of the State approved Proposition 218  a </br>constitutional initiative  entitled the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act”  “Proposition 218” . </br></br>Proposition 218 added Articles X</br>IIIC and XIIID to the California Constitution and contained a </br>number of interrelated provisions affecting the ability of local governments  including the City  </br></br>to levy and collect both existing and future taxes  assessments  fees and charges. </br> </br>Section 1 of Article XIIIC requires majority voter approval for the imposition  extension </br>or increase of general taxes and Section 2 thereof requires two thirds voter approval for the </br></br>imposition  extension or increase of special taxes. These voter approval requirements of Article </br></br>XIIIC reduce the flexib</br>ility of the City to raise revenues by the levy of general or special taxes </br>and  given such voter approval requirements  no assurance can be given that the City will be </br></br>able to enact  impose  extend or increase any such taxes in the future to meet increased </br></br>expenditure requirements. The City has not enacted  imposed  extended or increased any tax </br></br>since the effective date of Proposition 218. </br> </br>Section 3 of Article XIIIC expressly extends the initiative power to give voters the power </br>to reduce or repeal local taxes  assessments  fees and charges  regardless of the date such </br></br>taxes  assessments  fees or charges were imposed. Section 3 expands the initiative power to </br></br>include reducing or repealing assessments  fees and charges  which had previously been </br></br>considered administrative rather than legislative matters and therefore beyond the initiative </br></br>power. This extension of the initiative power is not limited by the terms of Article XIIIC to fees </br></br>imposed after November 6  1996  the effective date of Proposition 218  and absent other legal </br></br>authority could result in the reduction in any existing taxes  assessments or fees and charges </br></br>imposed prior to November 6  1996. </br> </br>“Fees” and “charges” are not expressly defined in Article XIIIC or in SB </br>919  the </br>Proposition 218 Omnibus Implementation Act enacted in 1997 to prescribe specific procedures </br></br>and parameters for local jurisdictions in complying with Article XIIIC and Article XIIID  “SB </br></br>919” . However  on July 24  2006  the California Supreme Court ruled in </br>Bighorn Desert View </br></br>Water Agency v. Virjil  Kelley </br>  the “Bighorn Decision”  that charges for ongoing water delivery </br>are property related fees and charges within the meaning of Article XIIID and are also fees or </br></br>charges within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIIIC. The California Supreme Court held </br></br>that such water service charges may  therefore  be reduced or repealed through a local voter </br></br>initiative pursuant to Section 3 of Article XIIIC.  </br> </br>In the Bighorn Decision  the Supreme Court did state that nothing in Section 3 of Article </br>XIIIC authorizes initiative measures that impose voter approval requirements for f</br>uture </br>increases in fees or charges for water delivery. The Supreme Court stated that water providers </br></br>may determine rates and charges upon proper action of the governing body and that the </br></br>governing body may increase a charge which was not affected by a prior initiative or impose an </br></br>entirely new charge.  </br> </br>The Supreme Court further stated in the Bighorn Decision that it was not holding that </br>the initiative power is free of all limitations and was not determining whether the initiative </br></br>power is subject to the statutory provision requiring that water and wastewater service charges </br></br>be set at a level that will pay debt service on bonded debt and operating expenses. Such </br></br>initiative power could be subject to the limitations imposed on the impairment of contracts </br></br>under the contract clause of the United States Constitution. Additionally  SB 919 provides that </br></br>the initiative power provided for in Proposition 218 “shall not be construed to mean that any </br></br>owner or beneficial owner of a municipal security  purchased before or after  the effective date </br></br>of Proposition 218  assumes the risk of  or in any way consents to  any action by initiative </br></br>measure that constitutes an impairment of contractual rights” protected by the United States </br> 79  </br>Constitution. No assurance can be given that the voters of the City w</br>ill not  in the f</br>uture  </br>approve initiatives which repeal  reduce or prohibit the future imposition or increase of </br>assessments  fees or charges  including the City’s sewer service fees and charges  which are the </br></br>source of Net System Revenues pledged to the payment of debt service on Series 2008 Bonds </br></br>and other Outstanding Obligations. </br> </br>Notwithstanding the fact that sewer service charges may be subject to reduction or </br>repeal by voter initiative undertaken pursuant to Section 3 of Article XIIIC  the City has </br></br>covenanted to levy and charge rates which meet the requirements of the Installment Purchase </br></br>Agreement in accordance with applicable law.  </br> </br>Article XIIID defines a “fee” or “charge” as any levy other than an ad valorem tax  </br>special tax  or assessment imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property </br></br>ownership  including a user fee or charge for a property related service. A “property related </br></br>service” is defined as “a public service having a direct relationship to a property ownership.” </br></br>In the Bighorn Decision  the California Supreme Court held that a public water agency’s </br></br>charges for ongoing water delivery are fees and charges within the meaning of Article XIIID. </br></br>Article XIIID requires that any agency imposing or increasing any property related fee or </br></br>charge must provide written notice thereof to the record owner of each identified parcel upon </br></br>which such fee or charge is to be imposed and must conduct a public hearing with respect </br></br>thereto. The proposed fee or charge may not be imposed or increased if a majority of owners of </br></br>the identified parcels file written protests against it. As a result  the local government’s ability </br></br>to increase such fee or charge may be limited by a majority protest. </br> </br>In addition  Article XIIID also includes a number of limitations applicable to existing </br>fees and charges including provisions to the effect that  i  revenues derived from the fee or </br></br>charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service;  ii  such </br></br>revenues shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was </br></br>imposed;  iii  the amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident </br></br>of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the </br></br>parcel; and  iv  no such fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is </br></br>actually used by  or immediately available to  the owner of the property in question. Property </br></br>related fees or charges based on potential or future use of a service are not permitted. </br> </br>The City’s current sewer rates comply with the notice and substantive provisions of </br>Article XIIID. Three lawsuits filed against the City challenging the sewer rates as they were </br></br>structured prior to October 2004  before the City incorporated a COD component. The Shames </br></br>Settlement resulted in a $35 m</br>illion rebate to eligible single family residential customers and $5 </br>million in attorneys’ fees  as discussed previously under Wastewater System Financial </br></br>Operations. The two other lawsuits were filed on behalf of local restaurants and multifamily </br></br>residential customers are still pending. See “LITIGATION” for a description of the two </br></br>lawsuits. </br> </br>Article XIIID establishes procedural requirements for the imposition of assessments  </br>which are defined as any charge upon real property for a special benefit conferred upon the </br></br>real property. Standby charges are classified as assessments. Procedural requirements for </br></br>assessments under Article XIIID include conducting a public hearing and mailed protest </br></br>procedure  with notice to the record owner of each parcel subject to the assessment. The </br></br>assessment may not be imposed if a majority of the ballots returned oppose the assessment  </br></br>with each ballot weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected </br></br>parcel. To provide guidance to City staff regarding the conduct of Proposition 218 “property </br></br>related fee” protest proceedings  the City Council adopted Resolution R 302245 in January </br></br>2007 establishing additional procedures for submitting protests against proposed increases to </br></br>sewer rates  including the provision of notice of a proposed change in sewer fees to all owners </br> 80  </br>of record on each identified parcel and all wastewater customers of the City as reflected in the </br>billing records of the City at the time the notice is given  and additional procedures for the </br></br>tabulation of protests against proposed increases to sewer service charges  including guidelines </br></br>for determining when a valid protest has been submitted.  </br> </br>The City and the City Attorney are of the opinion that current sewer fees and charges </br>that are subject to Proposition 218 comply with the provisions thereof and that the City w</br>ill continue to comply with the rate covenant set forth in the Installment Purchase Agreement in </br></br>conformity with the provisions of Article XIIID of the California State Consti</br>tution. Should it </br>become necessary to increase the sewer fees and charges above current levels  the City would </br></br>be required to comply with the requirements of Article XIIID in connection with such proposed </br></br>increase. Under existing standards  the City and the City Attorney are of the opinion that rates </br></br>and charges may be established at levels which would permit deposits to a Rate Stabilization </br></br>Fund or maintenance of uncommitted cash reserves. See “WASTEWATER SYSTEM </br></br>FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—Financial Projections.” </br> </br>The interpretation and application of Proposition 218 w</br>ill ultimately be determined by </br>the courts or through implementing legislation with respect to a number of the matters </br></br>described above  and it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the outcome of </br></br>such determination or the nature or scope of any such legislation. </br> </br> TAX MATTERS </br> </br>Federal tax law contains a number of requirements and restrictions which apply to the </br>Series 2010A Bonds  including investment restrictions  periodic payments of arbitrage profits </br></br>to the United States  requirements regarding the proper use of bond proceeds and the facilities </br></br>financed therewith  and certain other matters. The Authority and the City have covenanted to </br></br>comply with all requirements that must be satisfied in order for the interest on the Series 2010 </br></br>Bonds to be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Failure to comply </br></br>with certain of such covenants could cause interest on the Series 2010 Bonds to become </br></br>includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance </br></br>of the Series 2010 Bonds. </br> </br>Subject to the Authority’s and the City’s compliance with the above referenced </br>covenants  under present law  in the opinion of Quint &amp; Thimmig LLP  Bond Counsel  interest </br></br>on the Series 2010 Bonds  i  is excludable from the gross income of the owners thereof for </br></br>federal income tax purposes  and  ii  is not included as an item of tax preference in computing </br></br>the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations  but interest on the Series </br></br>2010 Bonds is taken into account  however  in computing an adjustment used in determining </br></br>the federal alternative minimum tax for certain corporations. </br> </br>Bond Counsel expects to deliver an opinion at the time of delivery of the Series 2010 </br>Bonds in substantially the form set forth in APPENDIX C—”FORM OF BOND COUNSEL’S </br></br>OPINION.” </br> </br>Bond Counsel’s opinion represents its legal judgment based upon its review of the law </br>and the facts that it deems relevant to render such opinion and is not a guarantee of a result. </br> </br>The Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended  the “Code”   includes provisions for </br>an alternative minimum tax  “AMT”  for corporations in addition to the corporate regular tax </br></br>in certain cases. The AMT  if any  depends upon the corporation’s alternative minimum </br></br>taxable income  “AMTI”   which is the corporation’s taxable income with certain adjustments. </br> 81  </br>One of the adjustment items used in computing the AMTI of a corporation  with certain </br>exceptions  is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation’s “adjusted current </br></br>earnings” over an amount equal to its AMTI  before such adjustment item and the alternative </br></br>tax net operating loss deduction . “Adjusted current earnings” would include certain tax </br></br>exempt interest  including interest on the Series 2010A Bonds. </br> </br>Ownership of the Series 2010A Bonds may result in collateral federal income tax </br>consequences to certain taxpayers  including  without limitation  corporations subject to the </br></br>branch profits tax  financial institutions  certain insurance companies  certain S corporations  </br></br>individual recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and taxpayers who may </br></br>be deemed to have incurred  or continued  indebtedness to purchase or carry tax exempt </br></br>obligations. Prospective purchasers of the Series 2010 Bonds should consult their tax advisors </br></br>as to applicability of any such collateral consequences. </br> </br>The issue price  the “Issue Price”  for each maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds is the </br>price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds is first sold to </br></br>the public. The Issue Price of a maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds may be different from the </br></br>price set forth  or the price corresponding to the yield set forth  on the cover page hereof. </br> </br>If the Issue Price of a maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds is less than the principal </br>amount payable at maturity  the difference between the Issue Price of each such maturity  if </br></br>any  of the Series 2010 Bonds  the “OID Bonds”  and the principal amount payable at </br></br>maturity is original issue discount. </br> </br>For an investor who purchases an OID Bond in the initial public offering at the Issue </br>Price for such maturity and who holds such OID Bond to its stated maturity  subject to the </br></br>condition that the Authority and the City comply with the covenants discussed above   a  the </br></br>full amount of original issue discount with respect to such OID Bond constitutes interest </br></br>which is excludable from the gross income of the owner thereof for federal income tax </br></br>purposes;  b  such owner will not realize taxable capital gain or market discount upon </br></br>payment of such OID Bond at its stated maturity;  c  such original issue discount is not </br></br>included as an item of tax preference in computing the alternative minimum tax for </br></br>individuals and corporations under the Code  but is taken into account in computing an </br></br>adjustment used in determining the alternative minimum tax for certain corporations under </br></br>the Code  as described above; and  d  the accretion of original issue discount in each year may </br></br>result in an alternative minimum tax liability for corporations or certain other collateral federal </br></br>income tax consequences in each year even though a corresponding cash payment may not be </br></br>received until a later year. Owners of OID Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with </br></br>respect to the state and local tax consequences of original issue discount on such OID Bonds. </br> </br>Owners of Bonds who dispose of Bonds prior to the stated maturity  whether by sale  </br>redemption or otherwise   purchase Bonds in the initial public offering  but at a price different </br></br>from the Issue Price or purchase Bonds subsequent to the initial public offering should consult </br></br>their own tax advisors. </br> </br>If a Bond is purchased at any time for a price that is less than the Bond’s stated </br>redemption price at maturity or  in the case of an OID Bond  its Issue Price plus accreted </br></br>original issue discount reduced by payments of interest included in the computation of </br></br>original issue discount and previously paid  the “Revised Issue Price”   the purchaser will be </br></br>treated as having purchased a Series 2010A Bond with market discount subject to the market </br></br>discount rules of the Code  unless a statutory de minimis rule applies . Accrued market </br></br>discount is treated as taxable ordinary income and is recognized when a Bond is disposed of </br></br> to the extent such accrued discount does not exceed gain realized  or  at the purchaser’s </br></br>election  as it accrues. Such treatment would apply to any purchaser who purchases an OID </br> 82  </br>Bond for a price that is less than its Revised Issue Price even if the purchase price exceeds par. </br>The applicability of the market discount rules may adversely affect the liquidity or secondary </br></br>market price of such Bond. Purchasers should consult their own tax advisors regarding the </br></br>potential implications of market discount with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds. </br> </br>An investor may purchase a Series 2010A Bond at a price in excess of its stated </br>principal amount. Such excess is characterized for federal income tax purposes as “bond </br></br>premium” and must be amortized by an investor on a constant yield basis over the remaining </br></br>term of the Bond in a manner that takes into account potential call dates and call prices. An </br></br>investor cannot deduct amortized bond premium relating to a tax exempt bond. The </br></br>amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the tax exempt interest received. As </br></br>bond premium is amortized  it reduces the investor’s basis in the Bond. Investors who </br></br>purchase a Bond at a premium should consult their own tax advisors regarding the </br></br>amortization of bond premium and its effect on the Bond’s basis for purposes of computing </br></br>gain or loss in connection with the sale  exchange  redemption or early retirement of the Bond. </br> </br>There are or may be pending in the Congress of the United States legislative proposals  </br>including some that carry retroactive effective dates  that  if enacted  could alter or amend the </br></br>federal tax matters referred to above or affect the market value of the Series 2010 Bonds. It </br></br>cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such proposal might be enacted or whether  if </br></br>enacted  it would apply to bonds issued prior to enactment. Prospective purchasers of the </br></br>Series 2010 Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed </br></br>federal tax legislation. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any pending or proposed </br></br>federal tax legislation. </br> </br>The Internal Revenue Service  the “Service”  has an ongoing program of auditing tax </br>exempt obligations to determine whether  in the view of the Service  interest on such tax </br></br>exempt obligations is includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income </br></br>tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the Service will commence an audit of the </br></br>Series 2010 Bonds. If an audit is commenced  under current procedures the Service may treat </br></br>the Authority as a taxpayer and the Bondholders may have no right to participate in such </br></br>procedure. The commencement of an audit could adversely affect the market value and </br></br>liquidity of the Series 2010 Bonds until the audit is concluded  regardless of the ultimate </br></br>outcome. </br> </br>Payments of interest on  and proceeds of the sale  redemption or maturity of  tax </br>exempt obligations  including the Series 2010 Bonds  are in certain cases required to be </br></br>reported to the Service. Additionally  backup withholding may apply to any such payments to </br></br>any Bond owner who fails to provide an accurate Form W 9 Request for Taxpayer </br></br>Identification Number and Certification  or a substantially identical form  or to any Bond </br></br>owner who is notified by the Service of a failure to report any interest or dividends required to </br></br>be shown on federal income tax returns. The reporting and backup withholding requirements </br></br>do not affect the excludability of such interest from gross income for federal tax purposes. </br> </br>The Bonds are issued to refund bonds issued before January 1  2009  and therefore are </br>treated as issued before 2009 for purposes of section 265 b  7  of the Code relating to interest </br></br>expense deductibility for financial institutions. The treatment of interest expense for financial </br></br>institutions owning such Bonds may be less favorable than the treatment provided to owners </br></br>of tax exempt bonds treated as issued in 2009 or 2010. Financial institutions should consult </br></br>their tax advisors concerning such treatment. </br> </br>In the further opinion of Bond Counsel  interest on the Series 2010A Bonds is exempt </br>from California personal income taxes. </br>  83  </br>Ownership of the Series 2010A Bonds may result in other state and local tax </br>consequences to certain taxpayers. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such </br>collateral consequences arising with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds. Prospective purchasers </br></br>of the Series 2010 Bonds should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicab</br>ility of any </br>such state and local taxes. </br> </br> CONTINUING DISCLOSURE </br> </br>Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Certificate of the City  the “Disclosure </br>Certificate”   the City has agreed to provide  or cause to be provided  to Municipal Securities </br></br>Rulemaking Board in the manner prescribed by the Securities Exchange Commission certain </br></br>annual financial information and operating data concerning the City. The annual report to be </br></br>filed by the City is to be filed not later than 270 days following the end of the City’s Fiscal Year </br></br> currently June 30   commencing with the Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2009  and is to include </br></br>audited financial statements of the City.  </br> </br>Beginning in March 2004  the City failed to comply with undertakings related to 21 </br>bond issues for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 due to the unavailab</br>ility of the City’s </br>audited financial statements. The circumstances regarding the unavailability of the City’s </br></br>audited financial statements are described under the caption entitled “INTRODUCTION—</br></br>Certain Information Regarding the City.” Each required annual report and audited financial </br></br>statement was subsequently filed. Prior to March 2004  the City had never failed to comply </br></br>with its undertakings with regard to Rule 15c2 12.  </br> </br>The City has timely filed the annual reports and financial statements for Fiscal Year </br>2008 with respect to securities secured by the Sewer Revenue Fund  the Water Ut</br>ility Fund and </br>the City’s General Fund. The City Council received and filed the fiscal year 2009 audited </br></br>financial statements on February 1  2010  and the corresponding continuing disclosure f</br>ilings </br>were made on March 25  2010.  </br> </br>The City’s covenants in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate have been made in order </br>to assist the Underwriters in complying with the Rule. A failure by the City to comply with any </br></br>of the covenants therein is not an event of default under the Indenture.  </br> </br> LITIGATION </br> </br>There is no litigation pending against the City or  to the knowledge of its respective </br>executive officers  threatened  seeking to restrain or enjoin the issuance  sale  execution or </br></br>delivery of the Series 2010A Bonds or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of the </br></br>Series 2010A Bonds or the Authorizations or any proceedings of the City taken with respect to </br></br>the issuance or sale thereof  or the pledge or application of any moneys or security provided </br></br>for the payment of the Series 2010A Bonds or the use of the proceeds of the Series 2010A </br></br>Bonds. </br> </br>There are no pending lawsuits that  in the opinion of the City Attorney  challenge the </br>validity of the above issue  the corporate existence of the City  or the title of the executive </br></br>officers to their respective offices. In connection with this review  attention has been given to </br></br>not only litigation pending against the City  but also litigation pending against the </br></br>Department. The Office of the City Attorney has prepared the following summary  as of </br></br>May 14  2009  certain claims and lawsuits  for which the estimated loss to the City as of such </br></br>date exceeds $1 million  “Material Litigation”   pending against the Sewer Revenue Fund for </br> 84  </br>construction claims and certain other alleged liabilities arising during the ordinary course of </br>operations of the Wastewater System: </br> </br>• There are two class action lawsuits pending  each alleging that the City failed </br>to include a COD cost component in the sewer rate structure prior to October 2004  </br></br>which led to overcharges on sewer fees for certain customer groups that were </br></br>disproportionate to the cost of service for such customer groups. While the allegations </br></br>in both lawsuits are similar to those set forth in Shames  a class action lawsuit on </br></br>behalf of all single family residential account holders that was settled in 2007  see </br></br>“WASTEWATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS—City Council Actions </br></br>Relating to Sewer Rate Changes”   the City’s defenses and potential liability relative to </br></br>the two pending lawsuits are different from those in Shames. </br>  California </br>Restaurant Management System v. City of San Diego</br>. Plaintiffs </br>filed this class action case on August 20  2007 on behalf of local food </br></br>establishments  alleging that from 1994 to 2004 the City failed to properly </br></br>calculate the food establishments’ proportionate impact on the cost of operating </br></br>and maintaining the Wastewater System and seeking to recover their alleged </br></br>overpayment. The class was certified by the court on May 15  2009. The Court </br></br>granted the City s motion for summary judgment in October  2009  ending the </br></br>case without liability to the City. Plaintiffs have appealed the Court’s decision. </br></br>In the event of a successful appeal and an adverse ruling the City estimates the </br></br>liability could range from $0 to $5 million. </br>  Edmond A. Vigneau v. City of San Diego</br>. Plaintiffs filed this case on </br>September 17  2008 on behalf of multifamily residential customers  alleging the </br></br>City overcharged them for sewer service from 2000 to 2004  before the City </br></br>incorporated a COD component. Notwithstanding the absence of a COD cost </br></br>component  the City believes that the plaintiffs may have been undercharged </br></br>because other aspects of the pre October 2004 sewer rate for this customer </br></br>group  including the base fee for service  may have been too low. The Court </br></br>denied plaintiff s request for class action status in November 2009  keeping only </br></br>the named plaintiffs in the case and substantially reducing the City s potential </br></br>liability. It is unknown whether plaintiffs will appeal the decision. In the event of </br></br>a successful appeal and an adverse ruling the City estimates the liability could </br></br>range from $0 to $5 million  but the City anticipates the plaintiffs’ likelihood of </br></br>successfully proving overages is remote. </br></br> </br>• Timothy Cresto  et al. v. Taylor Woodrow Homes  Inc.  et al; Christopher Smith  et </br>al. v. Taylor Woodrow Homes  et al</br>. On August 21  2007  two sets of plaintiffs filed </br>lawsuits alleging that the City  Taylor Woodrow Homes  Inc. and certain other related </br></br>parties effected an inverse condemnation of and caused dangerous conditions on their </br></br>respective properties in a housing development known as Santaluz  by contributing to </br></br>the plaintiffs’ exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas  which allegedly emanated from the </br></br>Wastewater System. The cases have been coordinated for discovery and settlement </br></br>purposes. In the event of an adverse ruling  the City estimates the aggregate liability </br></br>resulting from these two cases could range from $0 to $20 million. The City has filed </br></br>cross complaints against the developer  the design engineer and the contractors seeking </br></br>indemnity for any damages that may be awarded to the plaintiffs. </br></br>  The Grande North at Santa Fe Place HOA v. Bosa Development  et al</br>. In </br>September 2009  plaintiff HOA filed a lawsuit against the City alleging that high levels </br></br>of hydrogen sulfide gas from the City s sewer system have corroded and damaged the </br> 85  </br>building s plumbing. Plaintiff claims the City s sewer system is defective because it </br>does not include an “odorless connection” where the HOA s sewer lateral connects to </br></br>the City s trunk sewer. The City s potential liability is currently unknown  as the City </br></br>has yet to learn the extent of the damage to plaintiff s plumbing  if any  allegedly </br></br>caused by hydrogen sulfide gas. Liability could be significant  if it is determined that </br></br>the plumbing to all 221 condominium units needs to be replaced. </br></br>  The Grande South at Santa Fe Place HOA v. Bosa Development  et al. </br>In February  </br>2010  the City was served with a lawsuit with the same allegations as The Grande </br></br>North  but for its sister development The Grande South. The allegations and potential </br></br>liability are the same in both cases. </br> The City believes it has sufficient defenses against such claims and lawsuits and in no </br>event should these claims and lawsuits result in judgments or settlements which  in the </br></br>aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on the Sewer Revenue Fund’s financial </br></br>position. </br> </br> LEGAL OPINION </br> </br>The validity of the Series 2010A Bonds and certain other matters are subject to the </br>approving opinion of Quint &amp; Thimmig LLP  San Francisco  California  Bond Counsel. A </br></br>complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is contained in APPENDIX C </br></br>attached hereto. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Authority by Quint &amp; </br></br>Thimmig LLP acting as Disclosure Counsel to the Authority for the Series 2010A Bonds  and </br></br>by Jan I. Goldsmith  City Attorney  and for the Underwriters by their counsel  Stradling  Yocca  </br></br>Carlson &amp; Rauth  A Professional Corporation  Newport Beach  California. </br> </br> RATINGS </br> </br>Moody’s  S&amp;P and Fitch have assigned the Series 2010A Bonds their ratings of “A2 ” </br>“A+” and “AA  ” respectively  and issued “stable” outlooks in connection with their ratings. </br></br>Such ratings reflect only the views of such organizations and any desired explanation of the </br></br>significance of such ratings should be obtained from the rating agency furnishing the same  at </br></br>the following addresses: Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services  55 Water Street  New York  New </br></br>York 10041; Fitch Ratings  One State Street Plaza  New York  New York 10004; Moody’s </br></br>Investors Service  Inc.  7 World Trade Center  250 Greenwich Street  New York  New York </br></br>10007. Generally  a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to </br></br>it and on investigations  studies and assumptions of its own. </br> </br>There is no assurance such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that </br>such ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies  if in </br></br>the judgment of such rating agencies  circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision </br></br>or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series </br></br>2010A Bonds.  </br> </br> UNDERWRITING </br> </br>The Series 2010A Bonds are being purchased by the Underwriters named on the cover </br>page to this Official Statement  collectively  the “Underwriters” . The Underwriters have </br> 86  </br>agreed  subject to certain conditions  to purchase the Series 2010A Bonds at a purchase price </br>of $171 991 922.77  equal to the original principal amount thereof  plus an original issue </br></br>premium of $10 782 027.45  less an Underwriters’ discount in the amount of $720 104.68. The </br></br>Underwriters may offer and sell the Series 2010A Bonds to certain dealers and others at prices </br></br>lower than the offering prices. The offering prices may be changed from time to time by the </br></br>Underwriters. </br> </br>One of the Underwriters  Piper Jaffray &amp; Co.  “Piper”   has entered into an agreement </br> the “Distribution Agreement”  with Advisors Asset Management  Inc.  “AAM”  for the </br></br>distribution of certain municipal securities offerings allocated to Piper at the original offering </br></br>prices. Under the Distribution Agreement  if applicable to the Series 2010A Bonds  Piper w</br>ill share with AAM a portion of the fee or commission  exclusive of management fees  paid to </br></br>Piper. </br> </br> FINANCIAL ADVISOR </br> </br>First Southwest Company  Santa Monica  California served as Financial Advisor to the </br>City with respect to the sale of the Series 2010A Bonds. The Financial Advisor has not </br></br>undertaken to make an independent verification or to assume responsibility for the accuracy  </br></br>completeness  or fairness of the information contained in this Official Statement. </br> </br> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 </br> </br>The City’s basic financial statements include the financial statements of the Sewer </br>Revenue Fund.

The State continues to struggle </br>to balance its budget resulting in </br>ongoing uncertainty with respect to the City™s expected revenues.</br>   Economic Development Activities</br>   </br>The City addressed the economic downturn in fiscal year 2009 by increasing community </br></br>investment  promoting business </br>growth and retention</br>  </br>and by competing successfully for </br>federal stimulus funds.</br>  The City division of Economic Growth Services  EGS  </br>worked</br> to </br>create and retain jobs and taxable investment in the City of San Diego. EGS consists of two </br></br>focused work units: t</br>he Business Expansion  Attraction  and Retention Team and the </br>Government Incentives Team.</br>  </br>These two teams work directly with businesses  business </br>organizations  and City departments to create a business</br> friendly environment that </br>promotes</br> a stable economy.</br>  </br>Economic growth  energy independence  revenue </br>enhancement  and community revitalization are accomplished by attracting new companies  </br></br>retaining and or expanding existing companies  making San Diego competitive in emerging </br>markets  and revitalizing older </br>business communities.</br>   </br> 12CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Due to the economic downturn</br>  </br>Economic Growth Services has placed a strong emphasis on </br>its </br>business retention mission.</br>   In fiscal year 2009 EGS developed and executed successful </br>business retention efforts for Sony Electronics  Cri</br>cket Corporation  Circle Foods  Lockheed </br>Martin  Eli Lilly  and Camel</br>Bak.  </br>These efforts resulted in the creation or retention of </br>approximately 2 900</br> San Diego based jobs.</br>  </br>In the current fiscal year  EGS worked with </br>Alliant Techsystems  Inc to retain or create 200 San Diego based jobs.</br>  </br>The capital </br>investments made by the companies EGS assisted in fiscal year</br> 2009 and fiscal year</br> 2010 </br>represent a cumulative investment of more than $368 million of construction and renovation </br>activity for our local economy.   </br> The ﬁCertificate of Deposit Account Registry Serviceﬂ  CDARS  is a deposit</br> placement </br>service designed to allow FDIC</br> insured depository institutions to accept deposits of more </br>than $100 000  currently $250 000  and obtain full coverage for the depositor </br>by spreading </br>the funds among as many separate FDIC insured institutions as necessary so that no </br>institution holds more than $250 000  principal plus interest  for each depositor.  </br>To support local reinvestment  the City increased its CDARS</br> investment from </br>$5 million to $15 </br>million in </br>fiscal y</br>ear 2009. The City plans to increase the allowable investment in the CDARS </br>program to approximately $40 million in </br>fiscal y</br>ear 2010.</br>   The authorized CDARS </br>investment program allows the City to invest millions of dollar</br>s into fully insured FDIC non</br> negotiable certificates of deposit.  </br>The initial deposit is split among small community banks </br>throughout the country so that any single Certificate of Deposit at a financial institution </br></br>does not exceed the $250 000 FDIC insura</br>nce limit.</br>  The banks participating </br>in the</br> CDARS </br>network send an equal</br> amount of funds</br> back to local San Diego bank</br>s </br>to ensure th</br>at they</br> retain</br> funds equal to the City s initial</br> deposit</br> for</br> reinvestment </br>in the local community.</br>  </br>The </br>City™s investment in the</br> CDARS program assures that the full amount deposited at local </br>banks stay</br>s </br>in San Diego for</br> reinvestment in the community.</br>    </br> </br>According to the stimulus tracking website Recovery.org  California received more American </br>Recovery and Reinvestment Act  ARRA  dollars than any other state and the San Diego </br>region received the second largest total of stimulus dollars of any region in California </br> trailing Los Angeles .  As of November 19  2009  the San Diego region received 201 </br>projects totaling over $2.1 billion. </br> The City of San Diego can expect to see at least $340 </br>million in stimulus funding. Of this amount  approximately $290 million is for Federal </br>projects and will not come directly through the City; the remaining $50 million is expected </br></br>to come to the City ov</br>er the next six months. Projects including the modernization of Otay </br>Mesa™s Port of Entry and the San Ysidro border expansion project will alleviate congestion </br></br>and improve the productivity and efficiency of US Mexico border relations.  This money will </br></br>come</br> either directly to the City in the form of block grants and competitive awards  $49 </br>million  or to our partner agencies in which the City participates  such as </br>the San Diego </br>Association of Governments and the San Diego Workforce Partnership  $126 million </br>  or to </br>federal agencies pursuing major construction projects within the City of San Diego  $164 </br></br>million not including military projects .  These ARRA funds will be used on transportation  </br>housing  public safety and energy projects that will not only creat</br>e jobs but will provide long </br>term benefits for the City and the region. </br> Fiscal Challenges</br>   </br>The City of San Diego has faced significant financial challenges over the last several years </br>and has made a determined effort to improve its overall financial </br>condition</br> and </br>the quality </br>of its financial statements  internal controls</br>  and d</br>isclosure controls and procedures.  A few </br>of the City™s achievements include  1  the release of audited financial statements for </br>fiscal </br>year</br>s 2003</br> 2008 </br>in a two year period</br>;  2  the implementation of an annual five</br> year </br>13CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>financial outlook as a prudent planning tool;  3  the strengthening of the City™s General </br>Fund reserves;  4  fully funding the Annual Required Contribution  ARC  to the City™s </br>pension system</br> since fiscal year</br> 2006</br>;  5  new pension plan</br>s for police and</br> for non</br> public </br>safety employees hired on or after July 1  2009;  6  participation in a California Public </br>Employees™ Retirement System  CALPERs  trust for pre</br> funding of post</br> employment </br>healthcare benefits for ret</br>ired City employees;  7  rating upgrades from the national rating </br>agencies  including  in the case of one agency  the reinstatement of the City™s credit rating</br>; </br>and  8  re</br> entering the public bond market in 2009 </br>and issuing $1.6 billion in debt</br>  new </br>money </br>and refunding </br> after a five year absence.</br>  The City issued the Fiscal Year 2010 First Quarter Budget Monitoring Report on November </br>17  2009  which</br> presented a review of actual expenditures and receipts through September </br>2009 and projects annual expenditure</br>s and revenues for the General Fund through year </br>end. Based on this analysis  the City expects a shortfall of approximately $7.5 million in </br></br>fiscal year 2010</br>  </br>primarily as a result of declining sales tax and T</br>ransient Occupancy Tax </br> TOT  revenues.</br> The decline in major revenues is partially offset by conservative spending </br>and a hiring freeze that has been in effect since August 2009.</br>  </br>The Five Year Financial Outlook  Outlook  issued on October 1  2009  identified a projected </br></br>deficit for fiscal year 2011 of $179 million. The sensitivity analysis in the Outlook estimates </br>a deficit range of $168 to $200 million  primarily resulting from the possible fluctuation of </br>three major revenues: property tax; sales tax; and TOT. On November 24  the Mayor </br></br>presented a propos</br>ed 18 month budget for the remainder of fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year </br>2011 to remediate the projected fiscal year 2011 deficit of $179 million. On December 14  </br>2009 the City Council adopted the fiscal year 2010 budget revisions and the fiscal year 2011 </br>proposed budget.  The fiscal year 2011 budget framework approved by the City Council </br></br>includes a combination of transfers  new revenue  and annual expenditure reductions that </br></br>will impact services to City residents.  Further action  including labor negotiati</br>ons and </br>additional City Council approval  will be necessary to implement all recommended </br>adjustments. If the budget is implemented on January 1  2010 as recommended  savings of </br>approximately $24 million in fiscal year 2010 will be set aside to assist in ba</br>lancing the </br>fiscal year 2011 budget.</br>  </br>The City </br>publicly</br> issued</br> a </br>$125 million Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes  </br>TRAN  </br>on July </br>1  2009 and does</br> not </br>currently </br>foresee the need to issue additional notes to meet any </br>General Fund liquidity needs </br>for the </br>remainder</br> of fiscal year</br> 2010</br>. </br>The City treasury holds </br>approximately $2 billion that is invested primarily in US Treasuries and agencies  and </br></br>consistent with the City™s investment policy  has sufficient liquidity to meet all currently </br>foreseeable cash demands. </br> The General Fund reserves are approximately $</br>79 million</br> as of </br>the issuance of this report</br>  which includes $55 million set aside in an Emergency Reserve </br>Fund that can be accessed by a two</br> thirds vote of City Council. </br>  </br>Readers of these financial statements</br> should pay particular attention to Notes 12  13  18  </br>and 22  concerning Pension Plans  Other Post Employment Benefits  Contingencies  and </br>Subsequent Events  respectively.

The recession has slowed both </br>residential and commercial development </br>within our region.  This combined with a </br></br>contraction in business payrolls and </br>reduced travel spending has driven the </br>unemployment rate to historic levels.  </br>    </br> The City™s property tax revenue has grown </br></br>over the last five years  although at a </br></br>decreasing rate.</br>  </br>In fiscal year 2009 </br>General Fund property tax revenues were </br>$398.7 million compared to $384.3 m</br>illion </br>in fiscal year 2008  representing a 3.8% </br>growth.</br>  </br>However  due to the continued </br>decline in home prices  the budgeted fiscal </br>year 2010 property tax revenue in the </br>General Fund was projected to decline </br>4.0% over fiscal year 2009 actuals.</br>  </br>Subsequently</br>  based on updated </br>information from the County  the City </br></br>revised its estimate for property tax </br></br>revenue for fiscal year 2010 showing a </br>smaller decrease of 1.5% over the fiscal </br>year 2009 actual property tax revenue. </br>   The impact of lower business and </br></br>consumer spending has had a </br></br>significant effect on sales tax revenues.</br>  </br>In fiscal year 2009  actual General Fund </br>sales tax revenues  including safety </br>sales tax  were $212.9 million  a 9.6% </br>decline from 2008 sales tax revenue</br>s of </br>$235.6 million.</br>  </br>For fiscal year 2010  </br>the City budgeted a decline of 1.3% in </br>sales tax revenues.</br>  </br>However  the first </br>quarter actual sales tax receipts were </br>significantly below the budgeted </br>amount.</br>  </br>The City™s adjusted projection </br>for fiscal year 2010 </br>is now $191.2 </br>million  or 10.2% lower than actual </br>0.0</br>1.0</br></br>2.0</br></br>3.0</br></br>4.0</br>5.0</br>6.0</br></br>7.0</br></br>8.0</br></br>9.0</br>10.0</br></br>11.0</br>Employment Development Department</br> Unemployment Rates</br>San Diego County</br>20052006200720082009</br></br>City of San Diego</br>General Fund </br> Property Tax Revenue</br>20052006200720082009</br></br>City of San Diego</br>General Fund </br> Sales Tax Revenue</br>15CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>revenue received for fiscal year 2009. </br> San Diego remains a top tourist </br>destination due to the region™s natural </br></br>attractions; however  the tour</br>ism </br>industry has not escaped the impact of </br>the deteriorating economy.</br>  </br>The City™s </br>Transient Occupancy Tax  TOT  rate is </br>currently 10.5% and is allocated </br></br>according to the Municipal Code.</br>  </br>As </br>such  the General Fund receives 52% of </br></br>these revenues to be used f</br>or general </br>governmental purposes  and the TOT </br>fund receives the remaining 48% for the </br>purpose of promoting the City as a </br>tourism destination.

These expenses </br>supported all public services and the </br>significant fiscal obligations of the City  </br></br>including funding of the City™s pension </br>system  post</br> employment healthcare </br>benefits  and </br>capital improvements</br>.  Total </br>expenses for fiscal year 2009 were $2.</br>5 </br>billion</br>. Governmental activities were $1.7 </br>billion  of which 38% </br>was spent on public </br>safety for police</br>  </br>fire</br>  </br>and life safety services. </br>Business type activities </br>were $.8 billion</br>  of </br>which </br>85% of these expenses were for water </br>and wastewater expenses. </br> The City™s unfunded pension </br>liability remains a significant </br>obligation of the City.  The </br></br>City has aggressively </br>confronted this deficit  fully </br>funding the City™s Annual </br></br>Required Contribution  ARC  </br></br>beginning in fiscal year 2006  </br>and h</br>as made significant </br>additional payments in </br>excess of the ARC into the pension fund</br> in certain years.  The San Diego City Employee</br>s™ Retirement System  SDCERS  is the administrator of </br>the City™s</br> employee pension funds.  On </br>an annual basis  the pension fund portfolio and future pension obligations are evaluated by </br></br>an independent actuary to determine the full pension liability.  The June 30  200</br>8 valuation </br>calculated the unfunded pension liability to be approximately $1.303 billion. </br>The June 30  </br>2009 actuarial report is not complete as of the issuance of this report.</br> In fiscal year 2009</br>  </br>the global financial markets experienced significant declines.  The </br>effects of the market declines have been wide ranging and impact even the most diversified </br></br>investment portfolios. The S</br>DCERS investment portfolio is no exception. SDCERS employs a </br>long</br> term investment strategy.  The City™s ARC is determined using an asset smoothing </br>methodology which </br>dampen</br>s </br>the volatility </br>of the market</br> value of</br> asset</br>s which</br> occurs </br>from</br> fluctuations in market conditions. The ARC payment for fiscal year 2011 has </br>not </br>been </br>det</br>ermined by the SDCERS actuary</br> as of the issuance of this report; however  it has been </br>estimated </br>by the SDCERS actuary  presented to the Board on July 17  2009 and September </br>18  2009  </br>to be</br> approximately $224 million</br>.  This is an increase of $</br>70 million</br>  </br>or 45%  </br>over the ARC payment of $15</br>4 million</br> the City is obligated to fund in fiscal year 2010.  </br>Any </br>significant increase in the fiscal year 2011 ARC payment will require the City to reduce </br></br>operating expenses which will affect services and programs. </br></br> </br>In fiscal year 2008  </br>Governmental Accounting </br>Standards Board Statement </br>45  ﬁGASB 45ﬂ  went into </br>effect requiring all municipal </br>ActuarialActuarial</br>Funded</br>Valuation Date</br>Value of Assets</br>UAAL</br>Ratio</br>6 30 2005</br>2 983 080</br>$        1 452 937</br>$        67.3%</br>6 30 2006</br>3 981 932</br>          1 000 768</br>          79.9%</br>6 30 2007</br>4 413 411</br>          1 184 242</br>          78.8%</br>6 30 2008</br>4 660 346</br>          1 303 204</br>          78.2%</br>Pension Funding Progress </br> Thousands </br>ActuarialActuarial</br>Funded</br>Valuation Date</br>Value of Assets</br>UAALRatio</br>6 30 2008</br>29 637</br>$             1 206 070</br>$        2.4%</br>6 30 2009</br>41 497</br>              1 317 880</br>          3.1%</br>Retiree Healthcare Liabilities </br> Thousands </br>General </br>Government</br>12%Police</br>17%Fire &amp; Life </br>Safety</br>9%Parks &amp; </br>Recreation</br>11%Transportation</br>10%Sewer Utility</br>13%Water Utility</br>14%LT Debt </br>Interest</br>3%All Other</br>11%Total Government</br> Wide Expenses</br>17CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>governments to report on Other Post Employment Benefits  retiree healthcare costs  in a </br>manner similar to reporting on pension benefits.

As a fiscal precaution against natural disasters or unforeseen </br>events  the City maintains an emergency reserve fund that can only be accessed for </br>qualifying emergencies as declared by the Mayor and or City Council and approved by at </br>least a 2 3 </br>vote of the City Council.  The General Fund Reserve Policy set a funding goal of </br>7.0% of General Fund revenue by the end of fiscal year 2009. The General Fund reserve </br>was actually 7.</br>7% of General Fund revenue at June 30  2009  resulting in a total reserve </br>balance of $7</br>8.3 </br>million.  This balance is reported within the General Fund Balance Sheet as </br>Undesignated Fund Balance.  The reserves are currently cash funded within the City </br></br>Treasury™s pooled cash portfolio. The goal is to establish General Fund reserves</br> at 8% of </br>revenues by fiscal year 2012.</br>  </br>The </br>Fiscal year</br> 2010 Budget adopted in June 2009 reflected a reduction of expense growth </br>by reducing program expenditures and imposing an across the board 6%</br> reduction in</br> compensation </br>for</br> all City employees.  The City also was successful in redesigning the </br>pension benefit package for </br>most</br> employees</br> hired after July 1  2009.  </br>Due to a projected </br>decline in the City™s major revenues  management addressed the City™s projected budgetary </br></br>imbalance by proposing  and City Co</br>uncil then adopting  a </br>Fiscal year</br> 2010 Budget that </br>reduced spending on current services while also attempting to mitigate service level </br></br>reductions.  Council adopted a Fiscal year</br> 2010 Budget in June 2009 that balanced </br>estimated revenues to expenditures. </br>  During fiscal year 2009  total </br>long</br> term </br>liabilities of the City™s governmental activities </br>increased by $1</br>98 million.  This was primarily the result </br>of the </br>capital improvement</br> 2009A </br>lease revenue bond issue for $103 million for various capital improvement</br> projects and an </br>increase to the Net Other</br> Postemployment Benefits Obligation of $45 million.  Overall  our </br>annual interest costs for governmental activities were approximately $8</br>4 </br>million in fiscal </br>year 2009  which represents approximately 5% of our total</br> governmental activities </br>expenses</br>. </br> The City™s capital assets are essential to providing services to its residents and maintaining </br></br>the quality of its environment. During fiscal year 2009  total capital assets for governmen</br>tal </br>activities increased by $120</br> m</br>illion.  This was funded by a combination of developer </br>contributions  grant monies  and city </br>funded capital improvement programs.</br>  </br>The City™s </br>capital improvement</br> backlog is estimated to be approximately $800 to $900 </br>million according to the most recent Five Year Financial Outlook.  This</br> amount</br> is the most </br>recent estimate and</br> includes the cost of needed repairs to City facilities  streets and storm </br>drains but does not include </br>alleys  sidewalks </br>or soft costs</br>.  </br>The City is in the process of </br>18CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>assessing and updating its cost estimate for its capital improvement backlog.  </br>These costs </br>have been deferred because the City has not had the necessary funding resources.  </br>As mentioned above </br> the City issued $103 million in bonds </br>to fund deferred projects</br> during </br>fiscal year 2009</br>.  The bond proceeds will be used to </br>fund deferred</br> capital improvement</br> projects within the City. </br> The City™s Public Liability Fund  </br>which accounts for governmental </br>fund </br>related claims  has a </br>deficit </br>of approximately $4</br>9 </br>million as of </br>June 30  2009.</br>  This deficit </br>includes an accrued liability for </br></br>actuarially calculated claims costs  </br>incurred but not reported claims</br>  </br>and allocated and unallocated </br>loss</br>es </br>of approximately $5</br>9 </br>million</br>  </br>offset with the cash </br>reserves collected in the fund</br>.  This fund has seen significantly </br>higher claims since fiscal year </br>2005  largely as a result of the </br>legal claims and investigations </br></br>stemming from the pension fund </br></br>underpayment and related financial disclosure issues</br>; however</br>  </br>most of these unusual costs </br>were paid through</br> fiscal year 2007</br> and fiscal year 2008</br>.  The Workers™ Compensation Fund  </br>which accounts for both governmental and business</br> type claims  has a deficit of $114 </br>million as of June 3</br>0  2009. </br>This deficit includes an accrued liability for actuarially calculated </br>liabilities for open and unreported claims</br>  </br>as well as a provision for the allocated loss </br>adjustment expense totaling approximately $148 million</br>  </br>offset with the cash reserves </br>collected in the fund</br>.  The t</br>otal liability for workers compensation has decline</br>d </br>since fiscal </br>year 2007</br> due to a downward trend in the number of claims and the effect of State </br>legislation </br>regarding</br> workers compensation reform enacted in 2004.  </br>Per the City</br> Reserve </br>Policy  the City has budgeted funds annually to establish cash reserves</br> to reach the goal </br>of 50% of the </br>estimated outstanding liabilities</br> in each fund.  While the City is committed to </br>funding reserves in the Worker™s Compensation and Public Liabil</br>ity funds  </br>and has included </br>funding for these reserves in the fiscal year 2010 budget  the goal of funding 50% of </br></br>outstanding </br>liabilities</br> in both funds by 2014 is being reassessed given the economic </br>downturn and continued decline in General Fund revenues.</br>   </br></br></br>20052006200720082009</br></br>City of San Diego</br>Total Public Liability Claims Cash Payments</br>19CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Governmental Activities Key Indicators</br>            20 40 </br>60 80 100 120 20052006</br>20072008</br>2009Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>General Fund Cash and Investments</br>1 600 </br>1 700 </br>1 800 </br></br>1 900 </br>2 000 </br>2 100 </br></br>2 200 </br>20052006200720082009Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>Total Governmental Activities Long Term Liabilities</br>4 150 </br>4 200 </br>4 250 </br></br>4 300 </br>4 350 </br>4 400 </br></br>4 450 </br>20052006200720082009Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>Total Governmental Activities Capital Assets</br> 300 </br> 100 </br>100 300 20052006200720082009</br>Millions</br>Fiscal Year</br>Governmental Activites Unrestricted Net Assets</br> General Fund Cash </br>  Continued</br> expenditure savings </br>due </br>to vacancies and management </br>imposed reductions in discretionary </br>spending have helped the City to </br>maintain a relatively stable cash </br>position.</br> Total </br>Long Term </br>Liabilities</br>  The City issued $103 million in </br>Lease Revenue Bonds to finance </br>various public improvements during </br>FY 2009. The City™s obligation </br>related to Other Post</br> employment </br>Benefits also increased $45 million </br>in FY 2009  together creating an </br>increase in total</br> long term</br> liabilities </br>of approximately </br>10.1</br>%.  Capital Assets</br>  Capital Assets increase</br>d </br>by approximately $</br>120</br> million during </br>FY 2009.  This included capital </br>expenditures related to the City™s </br>new ERP system  seismic </br>retrofitting of the City™s bridge </br>infrastructure  and infrastructure </br>and </br>improvements to</br> repair street </br>damage resulting from </br>the Mt. </br>Soledad landslid</br>e. Unrestricted Net Assets</br>  Unrestricted Net Assets increased</br> approximately $</br>92 million in FY </br>2009.  This was primarily the result </br>of Redevelopment Agency revenues </br>exceeding expenses to fund multi</br> year capital improvements.</br>  20CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Business Type </br>Activities</br>   The majority of the City™s business</br> type activities are related to utilities that provide water </br>and wastewater services.  The Water and Metropolitan Wastewater Departments have been </br>consolidated into a single Public Utilities Department and </br>continue to</br> serve several regional </br>agencies outside of the City™s boundaries.  The utilities operations are mainly supported by </br>fees charged to customers.  The Independent Rate Oversight Committee  an independent </br>committee of stakeholders  monitors utility</br> rates and expenditures on behalf of the </br>ratepayers. </br></br> The City™s Water Utility Fund issued $</br>485</br> million of Water Revenue </br>and Revenue </br>Refunding </br>Bonds  Series 2009A</br> and 2009B during fiscal year 2009</br> to pre</br>pay outstanding principal of </br>$207 million of Subordin</br>ated Water Revenue Notes  Series 2007A</br> and 2008B; refund $94 </br>million of Certificates of Undivided Interest  Series 1998</br> monies; and to finance capital </br>improvements on the water system.</br> The publicly offered Water 2009A</br> and 2009B</br> Revenue </br>Refunding Bonds are </br>secured by and payable solely from net system revenues of the Water </br>Utility Fund.  </br>The City™s Wastewater Utility Fund issued $1.089 billion of Senior Sewer </br>Revenue Bonds to finance capital improvements to the wastewater system; fully refund </br>$22</br>4 </br>million in</br> wastewater revenue notes; and to refund approximately $6</br>83 million in </br>wastewater revenue bonds.  The net change in these notes and bonds payable during fiscal </br>year 2009 is the primary reason the business</br> type long term liabilities increased $344 </br>million o</br>ver fiscal year 2008. </br> For the year ended June 30  2009  the City™s business</br> type activities closed with restricted </br>and unrestricted cash and investment balances totaling $</br>1.2 billion</br>  an increase over fiscal </br>year 2008 of approximately $31</br>9 </br>million as a re</br>sult of the debt issues discussed above</br>.   </br>While the City™s capital assets for business</br> type activities have continued to increase in </br>value  deferred maintenance remains an ongoing challenge.  The City maintains a network </br></br>of </br>over 3</br> 000 miles of water pipes</br> and </br>over 3</br> 0</br>00 miles of sewer and waste water lines.</br>  Compliance with environmental regulations generally requires infrastructure construction  </br>including the replacement of water distribution systems </br> treatment plant upgrades  </br>the </br>replacement of wastewate</br>r collection systems  and improving sewage treatment capacity. </br>The City has agreed</br> with various state and federal regulators to build</br> significant </br>infrastructure upgrades.  In </br>June </br>2009  the City received</br> tentative approval of </br>a third five</br> year waiver permit from the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  and the state Regional </br>Water Quality Control Board </br>to continue operat</br>ing</br> the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment </br>Plant </br>at advanced primary treatment level</br>.  The City is still working with the California </br>Coastal </br>Commission to receive final wording on a consistency determination in support of </br>this EPA decision.  The resolution is anticipated in early 2010.</br>  The City is also facing challenges to the future of its water supplies. A persistent regional </br>drought and jud</br>icial decisions regarding management of the State Water Project has put </br>significant pressure on San Diego™s regional water supplies. The City of San Diego imports </br></br>as much as 90% of its water supply. Th</br>e reliability of th</br>at supply </br>has been</br> reduced </br>because </br>of court decisions  </br>weather conditions  </br>the diminishing availability of stored water  and </br>dwindling supplies of new water.  The City continues to work with its water wholesalers  the </br></br>San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of So</br>uthern </br>California  to </br>address </br>these supply issues but currently operates under a mandatory water </br>conservation target to achieve an 8% reduction in overall use.  The City™s performance from </br></br>June through September has averaged a monthly reduction of over 12%</br>. </br>The availability of </br>21CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>water has legal implications and could potentially affect City Council</br> findings regarding state </br>mandated water supply assessments for future development. These assessments must </br>demonstrate the long</br> term availability of water for large</br> projects before those projects can </br>be approved by local jurisdictions.  At this time  it is unclear what effect limitations to water </br>supplies would have on the City™s economy and its revenues</br> as the most recent project </br>assessments have all been able to fi</br>nd potable water offsets through the increased use of </br>reclaimed water</br>.  </br>The Mayor also proposed and the City Council approved in October 2009 a </br>revised Landscape Ordinance in advance of the state™s requirement to do so by January </br></br>2010.  The City is also moving forward with the California Department of Public Health to </br></br>undertake a demonstration project intended to verify that highly treated municipal </br>wastewater can be placed in a drinking water reservoir. </br> </br>Best Practice Operating Improvements</br>  The City took</br> a major leap forward on July 1  2009 when it went live with its new SAP </br>Enterprise Resource Planning  </br>ERP</br>  </br>financial system.  After two years of planning  the City </br>successfully began the transition to a</br>n </br>integrated financial system which allowed us to </br>eli</br>minate over a dozen legacy software applications.  Throughout fiscal year</br> 2010  core </br>functionality modules will be implemented  eliminating even more costly legacy software </br>applications and hardware.  The addition of </br>the ERP</br> system </br>and a well trained workforce </br>are </br>expected to</br> significantly improve the City™s financial operations and reporting capabilities.</br>  Internal controls over financial operations and reporting continue to be a focus issue for the </br>City.  As part of the </br>ERP</br> system  </br>the City has invested in an integrated internal controls </br>module called Governance  Risk and Compliance  GRC .  GRC  coupled with new process </br>and procedure documents </br> are expected</br> to improve our internal control environment. </br>In </br>addition  the City has established a comprehensive plan and has the proper staffing in place </br></br>to complete the remediation of </br>weaknesses in </br>internal controls over financial reporting </br>within 14 months.  </br> The Five Year Financial Outlook</br>  In October 2009  the City released an updated Five</br> Year Financial Outlook  the Outlook  for </br>fiscal year</br>s 2011 through 2015.  This document is an examination of the City™s long range </br>fiscal condition and financial challenges.  The City update</br>s </br>the Outlook p</br>eriodically to </br>account for changed circumstances. </br> </br>The City™s General Fund was the primary focus of the 2011</br> 2015 Outlook.  Approximately </br>68% of the City™s major revenues consist of four revenue sources: property tax  sales tax  </br></br>TOT</br>  and franchise fees.  Nearly 70% of the City™s General Fund expenditures are personnel </br>expenses.  Negative economic factors have resulted in a downward revision to revenue </br></br>projections for the </br>fiscal year</br> 2010 annual budget  which served as a base for the </br>Outlook.  </br>The Outlook discussed risks and opportunities that affect fiscal decisions and the City™s </br></br>ability to accomplish its strategic financial goals over the next five</br> year period.  These goals </br>include:</br>   Meet contractual obligations and fund mandated pr</br>ograms</br>  Contribute the full payment of the Annual Required Contribution  ARC  for the </br>City™s pension system</br>  Maintain </br>or enhance </br>General Fund and other reserves according to the City™s </br>Reserve Policy</br>  Preserve City services to the fullest extent possible </br>22CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>ForecastForecastForecastForecastForecast</br>GENERAL FUND</br>FY 2011FY 2012FY 2013FY 2014FY 2015</br>Projected Revenues</br>Property Tax</br>396.4</br>$      404.5</br>$      416.7</br>$      433.4</br>$      450.7</br>$      Sales Tax</br>182.7</br>        192.7</br>        200.2</br>        208.1</br>        218.8</br>        Transit Occupancy Tax</br>71.9</br>          74.1</br>          76.7</br>          79.7</br>          82.9</br>          Franchise Fees</br>75.0</br>          76.7</br>          78.5</br>          80.3</br>          82.2</br>          Other Revenues</br>335.6</br>        346.1</br>        353.3</br>        355.3</br>        362.0</br>        1 061.6</br>     1 094.1</br>     1 125.4</br>     1 156.8</br>     1 196.6</br>     Projected Expenses</br>Salary  Wages &amp; Benefits</br>611.8</br>        620.9</br>        627.2</br>        636.2</br>        622.7</br>        Operating Expenses</br>351.5</br>        363.1</br>        366.0</br>        382.5</br>        390.6</br>        Pension Expense</br>217.8</br>        206.5</br>        225.2</br>        242.5</br>        258.7</br>        Retiree Healthcare Expense</br>43.2</br>          46.8</br>          50.4</br>          54.2</br>          57.8</br>          General Fund Reserves</br>4.2</br>           7.9</br>           2.5</br>           2.5</br>           3.2</br>           Liability Funding </br>12.2</br>          7.8</br>           10.1</br>          4.8</br>                         1 240.7</br>     1 253.0</br>     1 281.4</br>     1 322.7</br>     1 333.0</br>      179.1 </br>$      158.9 </br>$      156.0 </br>$      165.9 </br>$      136.4 </br>$     Five Year Outlook for Fiscal Years 2011   2015</br>General Fund Projected Shortfall</br>   </br>The impact of continued declines in major revenue sources and increased costs for pension </br></br>funding are the leading factors in the fiscal year</br> 2011 forecasted budget deficit of $179 </br>million.</br>  </br>Because of the severity of </br>the </br>budget sho</br>rtfall  the Mayor has indicated that cuts to services </br>and programs will be inevitable in order for the City to maintain a balanced budget.  Within </br>the City  this will mean a workforce reduction combined with </br>expenditure savings </br>from </br>reduced or eliminated p</br>rograms and services</br>.  The Mayor™s budget plan for fiscal year 2011 </br>does not include contributions to fund reserves; however  the plan proposes that reserves </br>will not be spent and will be maintained at current levels. </br> Looking Forward</br>  These are difficult economic times  and the City has set challenging goals for its future.  The </br>City believes these goals are achievable with continued fiscal discipline and greater </br>government efficiency.  </br>In some revenue categories  San Diego has relative</br>ly low taxes and </br>fees compared to most other large municipalities in the United States.  </br>San Diego enjoys an </br>ideal location with agreeable weather year round.  The diversity of industry  education and </br>tourism well positions the City for an early economic rebound when the economy begins its </br>eventual recovery.</br>  Out of these challenging times  San Diego is restructuring its operations  services and </br>programs so that the City will emerge with a sound  fundamentally sustainable municipal </br>business model.  We have </br>addressed the issues that have created prior difficulties for this </br>City  and we are structuring ourselves for long</br> term solvency and flexibility.  We will </br>continue to live within our means and balance our annual budgets. </br></br>   23CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Purpose  Background</br>  and Scope of this Report</br>   San Diego City Charter § 111 requires the City to submit an annual report  including a </br></br>Statement of Net Assets  and requires that all accounts of the City be audited by an </br></br>independent auditor.

The City </br>comprises </br>342</br> square miles and  </br>as of January 1  200</br>9  the California Department of Finance estimates the population to be </br>1 353</br> 993</br>.  The City  with approximately </br>10 8</br>00 employees  provides a full range of </br>governmental services </br>including</br> police and fire protection  sanitation and health services  </br>the construction and maintenance of streets and infrastructure  recreational activities and </br></br>cultural events  and the maintenance and operation of the water and sewer utilities.</br>  Governing Structure</br> The City operates </br>under </br>and is governed by </br>the laws of the State of California and its own </br></br>Charter  </br>as periodically amended since its </br>adoption</br> by the electorate in 1931.  The City </br>is currently operating under a </br>Strong</br> M</br>ayor </br>form of government.  The departure</br>  on an </br>interim trial basis </br> from the City™s previous </br>Council </br>Manager form of government was </br>approved by a vote of the public and became </br></br>effective January 1  2006.  The Mayor is </br>elected at large to serve a four </br>year t</br>erm.  </br>  </br> Under the </br>Strong</br> M</br>ayor form of government  the Mayor is </br>the Chief Executive Officer of the City and has direct </br></br>oversight over all City functions and services except for the </br></br>City Council  Personnel  Ci</br>ty Clerk </br> Independent Budget </br>Analyst  IBA   City Attorney  and City Auditor </br>departments.  Under this form of government  the </br>City </br>Council is composed of eight members and is presided over </br>by the Council President  who is selected by a majority </br>vote of the </br>City </br>Council.  The Mayor presides over </br>City </br>Council in closed session meetings of the Council.  The </br></br>Council retains its legislative authority; however  all </br>City </br>Council resolutions</br> and ordinances</br> are subject to a veto of </br>the Mayor</br> except for certain ordina</br>nces including </br>emergency declarations and the City™s annual Salary and </br>Appropriations Ordinances</br>.  The City Council may override </br>a Mayoral veto with five votes.  The City Attorney  who is </br>elected for a four</br> year term  serves as the chief legal </br>advisor of a</br>nd attorney for the City and all departments.   </br> </br>During the County™s primary election held on June 3  2008  </br>voters approved Proposition B which requires </br>City </br>Council </br>to place a measure on the June 2010 ballot to allow voters </br>to decide whether the </br>Strong</br> M</br>ayor form of government </br>should become permanent effective January 1  2011.  Additionally  Proposition B provides </br>for the public to decide whether the number of </br>City </br>Council districts should increase from </br>eight to nine  and therefore  a corresponding increa</br>se of </br>City </br>Council votes required to </br>override the Mayor™s veto from five to six.  </br>Additionally  voters approved Proposition C</br>  </br>which separated the City Auditor™s Office from the Comptroller™s Office and made the Office </br></br>of the IBA permanent.  Under this ame</br>ndment  the City Auditor serves a </br>ten</br> year term and </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>20052006</br>200720082009</br></br>City of San Diego</br>Full Time and Part Time Employees</br>25CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>is supervised by an Audit Committee consisting of two Councilmembers and three members </br>of the public</br> with auditing expertise</br>  </br>who are appointed by the City Council</br>.

These financial statements are the respons</br>ibility of the City™s management. Our responsibility </br>is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit.  We di</br>d not audit the financial statements of the San Diego Housing Commissi</br>on  a discretely presented component unit  which </br>statements reflect 90%  95% and 85% of the total assets  total net assets and total revenues  respectively  </br></br>of the aggregate discretely presented component unit </br>totals.  Also  we did not audit the Southeastern </br>Economic Development Corporation  a blended component unit  which statements reflect less than 1% in </br>each of the total assets  total net assets and total revenues categories  respectively  of the aggregate </br></br>remaining fund information.  Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports </br></br>thereon has been furnished to us  and our opinion  insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the San </br>Diego Housing Commission and the Southeastern Economic Development Corporation is based solely on </br>the reports of the other auditors. </br>We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing </br>standards generally accepted in the United States of </br>America and the standards applicable </br>to financial audits contained in </br>Government Auditing Standards</br> issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.</br>  Those standards require that we plan and perform </br>the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whethe</br>r the financial statements are free of material </br>misstatement.  An audit includes consideration of in</br>ternal control over financial reporting as a basis for </br>designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances  but not for the purpose of expressing </br>an opinion on the effectiveness of the City™s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly  we </br></br>express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining  on a test basis  evidence supporting the </br>amounts and disclosures in the financial statements  assessing the accounting principles used and </br>significant estimates made by management  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement </br></br>presentation. We believe that our audit and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for </br></br>our opinions.   </br>In our opinion  based on our audit and the reports of other auditors  the financial statements referred to </br>above present fairly  in all material respects  the </br>respective financial position of the governmental </br>activities  the business type activities  the aggregate discretely presented component units  each major </br>fund  and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City as of June 30  2009  and the respective </br></br>changes in financial position and  where applicable  cash flows thereof for the year then ended in </br>conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </br>34As discussed in Note 1 to the basic financial statements  the City adopted the provisions of Governmental </br>Accounting Standards Board  GASB  Statement No. 49  </br>Accounting and Financial Reporting for </br>Pollution Remediation Obligations  effective July 1  2008.   </br>In accordance with Government Auditing Standards</br>  we have also issued our report dated </br>December 21  2009  on our consideration of the City™s internal control over financial reporting and on our </br>tests of its compliance with certain provisions of la</br>ws  regulations  contracts  and grant agreements and </br>other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testi</br>ng of internal control over </br>financial reporting and compliance and the results of th</br>at testing  and not to provide an opinion on the </br>internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit </br></br>performed in accordance with </br>Government Auditing Standards</br> and should be considered in assessing the </br>results of our audit. </br>The management™s discussion and analysis  schedules of funding progress and schedule of contributions </br>from employer and other contributing entities  and general fund budgetary information on pages 35 </br>through 48  168  and 172 through 174  respectively </br> are not a required part of the basic financial </br>statements but are supplementary information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the </br></br>United States of America. We have applied certain limited procedures  which consisted principally of </br></br>inquiries of management regarding the methods of measurement and presentation of the required </br>supplementary information. However  we did not audit the information and express no opinion on it.   </br>Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively </br>comprise the City™s basic financial statements. The in</br>troductory section  supplementary information  and  </br>statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic </br></br>financial statements.  The supplementary information has been subjected to the auditing procedures </br>applied by us and the other auditors in the audit of </br>the basic financial statements and  in our opinion  </br>based on our audit and the report of other auditors  is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the </br>basic financial statements taken as a whole. The in</br>troductory and statistical </br>sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied by us and the other auditors in the audit of the basic financial </br></br>statements and  accordingly  we express no opinion on them. </br>Certified Public AccountantsSan Diego  CaliforniaDecember 21  2009 </br>35CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br></br>MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</br>  Unaudited  </br> In Thousands </br> June 30  </br>2009 As management of the City of San Diego  City   </br>we offer readers of the City financial statements this narrative overview and </br>analysis of the financial activities of the City for the fiscal year ended June 30  </br>2009.   OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</br> This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the City™s basic financial statements.  The City™s ba</br>sic </br>financial statements are comprised of three compone</br>nts:  1  government</br> wide financial statements;  2  fund financial </br>statements; and  3  notes to the financial statements.  This report also contains other supplementary information in addition</br> to the basic financial statements. </br>GOVERNMENT</br> W</br>IDE </br>FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS</br>  The </br>focus of the </br>government </br>wide financial statements is on reporting on the operating results and financial position of the </br>government as an economic entity.  These statements are intended to report the entity™s operational accountability to its </br>readers  </br>giving information about the probable medium and long </br>term effects of past decisions on the government™s financial position</br>. </br>The statement of net assets presents information on all of the City™s assets and liabilities  with the difference between </br>the two </br>reported as net assets.  Over time  increases or decreases in net assets may serve as a useful indicator of whether the finan</br>cial </br>position of the City is improving or deteriorating. </br>The statement of activities presents information showing changes i</br>n the City™s net assets during the fiscal year </br>2009.  All </br>changes in net assets are reported when the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs  regardless of the timing of </br>related cash flows.  The focus is on both gross and net cost</br>s of City funct</br>ions  which are supported by general revenues.  This </br>Statement also distinguishes functions of the City that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues </br> governmental activities  from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user </br>fees and charges  business</br> type activities .  The governmental activities of the City include: General Government and Support; </br>Public Safety </br>  </br>Police; Public Safety </br>  </br>Fire and Life Safety</br> and Homeland Sec</br>urity</br>; Parks  Recreation  Culture and Leisure; </br>Transportation; Sanitation and Health; and Neighborhood Services.  The business</br> type activities of the City include:  Airports; </br>City Store; Development Services; Environmental Services; Golf Course; Recycling; Sewer Utility; and Water Utility. </br>The government</br> wide financial statements include the City  known as the</br>primary government  and the following legally </br>separate  discretely presented component units:  San Diego Convention Center Corporation  SDCCC ; and San Diego Housing </br>Commission  SDHC .  Financial information for these component units is reported separately from the financial information </br></br>presented for the primary government.  Blended component units  also legally separate entities  are </br>a part of the gov</br>ernment™s </br>operations and are combined with the primary government. </br>Included within the primary government as blended component units: </br> Centre City Development Corporation </br> CCDC </br>  City of San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Board Authority  MTDB Authority  </br> City of San Diego Tobacco Settlement Revenue Funding Corporation  TSRFC  </br> Community Facilities and Other Special Assessment Districts </br> Convention Center Expansion Financing Authority </br> CCEFA </br>  Public Facilities Financing Authority </br> PFFA </br>  Redevelopment Agency of the City of San Diego </br> RDA </br>  San Diego City Employees™ Retirement System  SDCERS </br>  San Diego Data Processing Corporation </br> SDDPC </br> 36CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br> San Diego Facilities and Equipment Leasing Corporation </br> SDFELC </br>  San Diego Industrial Development Authority  SDIDA  </br> San Diego Open Space Park Facilities District  1 </br> Southeastern Economic Development Corporation </br> SEDC </br>  Tourism Marketing District  TMD  </br> The government wide financial statements can be found beginning on page 52 of this report. </br> </br>FUND </br>FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS</br>  A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific </br>activities or objectives.  The City  like other state and local governments  uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate </br>compliance w</br>ith finance</br> related legal requirements.  All funds of the City can be divided into three categories: governmental </br>funds  proprietary funds  and fiduciary funds.</br> GOVERNMENTAL </br>FUNDS</br> Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions re</br>ported as governmental activities in the </br>government </br>wide financial statements.  However  unlike the government</br> wide financial statements  governmental fund financial </br>statements focus on near</br> term inflows</br>and outflows of spendable resources</br> as well as bala</br>nces of spendable resources </br>available at the end of the fiscal year.  Such information may be useful in evaluating a government™s near</br> term financing </br>requirements. </br>Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government</br> wide financi</br>al statements  it is useful to </br>compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in th</br>e government </br>wide financial statements.  By doing so  readers may better understand the long</br> term im</br>pact of the government™s </br>near term financing decisions.  Both</br> of the Governmental F</br>unds Balance S</br>heet and the </br>Governmental F</br>unds S</br>tatement of </br>Revenues  E</br>xpenditures  and </br>Changes in </br>Fund Balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison betwee</br>n governmental funds and governmental activities</br></br>The City maintains individual governmental funds.  Information is presented separately in the governmental funds balance shee</br>t and in the governmental funds statement of revenues  expenditures  and changes </br>in fund balances for the </br>General F</br>und  which </br>is a major fund.  Data from the other governmental funds are combined into a single  aggregated presentation.  Individual fun</br>d data for each of these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the </br>Supplementary Information section of this report. </br>The City adopts an annual appropriated budget for its </br>General F</br>und.  A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for </br>the General F</br>und to demonstrate compliance with this budget</br> and is presented as required supplementary information. </br>The basic governmental funds financial statements can be found beginning on </br>page 56 of this report.</br> PROPRIETARY </br>FUNDS</br> The City maintains two different types of proprietary funds  enterprise funds and internal service funds.  Enterprise </br>funds are </br>used to report the same functions presented as business</br> type</br>activities in the government</br> wide financial statements.  </br>The City </br>uses Enterprise Funds to</br> account for its various business</br> type activities  such as Sewer and Water Utilities.  Internal</br> Service </br>funds  such as </br>Fleet Services</br>  Central Stores  P</br>ublishing Services</br>  and Self Insurance  are used to report activities that provide </br>centralized supplies and</br> or services to the City.  All internal service funds  except for the </br>Special Engineering Fu</br>nd  have been </br>included within governmental activities in the government</br> wide financial statements since they predomina</br>ntly benefit </br>governmental functions.  The Special Engineering Fund  which services exclusively Sewer </br>and Water </br>activities  has been </br>included within business type activities in the government wide financial statements. </br></br>  37CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>Proprietary fund statements provide the same type of information as the government</br> wide financial statements  only in more </br>detail.  The proprietary fund</br>s financial statements</br> provide separate information for the Sewer </br>and Water </br>funds  which are </br>considered to be major funds of the City.  Data for the nonmajor</br> proprietary funds are combined into a single  aggregated </br>presentation</br>  and the internal service funds are combined into </br>a single  aggregated presentation as well.  Included in the </br>Supplementary Information section of this report are</br> i</br>ndividual fund data for the </br>nonmajor proprietary funds and the </br>internal </br>service funds.</br>  The basic proprietary funds financial statements can b</br>e found beginning on page </br>60 of this report. </br>FIDUCIARY </br>FUNDS</br> Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government.  Fiduciary funds ar</br>e not </br>reflected in the government</br> wide financial statement</br>s because the resources of those funds are not available to support the </br>City™s </br>operations.  The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. </br>The basic fiduciary funds financial statements can be found beginning on page 63 of this report. </br>NOTES TO THE </br>FINANCIAL </br>STATEMENTS</br> The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government</br> wide and </br>fund financial statements.  The notes to the financial statements can be found beginning on page 65 of this report. </br>OTHER </br>INFORMATION</br> In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes  this report also presents certain required supplementar</br>y information concerning the City™s progress in funding its obligation to provide</br> pension and postemployment healthcare benefits to </br>its employees</br>  and the General Fund™s budgetary comparison schedule</br>.  Required supplementary information can be found </br>beginning on page </br>170 of this report. </br>The </br>individual fund data</br> referred to earlier in c</br>onnection with nonmajor governmental funds  nonmajor </br>proprietary </br>funds  internal </br>service funds  and fiduciary funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information on pensions</br> and </br>the General Fund budgetary comparison s</br>chedule</br>  beginning on </br>page 199 of this report. </br>   </br>        </br>  38CITY</br> OF SAN DIEGOCOMPREHENS</br>IVE</br> ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT</br>GOVERNMENT WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS </br> CITY OF SAN DIEGO S SUMMARY OF NET ASSETS</br> In Thousands </br>200920082009200820092008Capital Assets</br>4 455 525</br>$          4 335 317</br>$     4 766 721</br>$          4 634 918</br>$     9 222 246</br>$          8 970 235</br>$     Other Assets</br>2 110 185</br>            2 096 751</br>       1 357 070</br>            1 031 815</br>       3 467 255</br>            3 128 566</br>       Total Assets</br>6 565 710</br>            6 432 068</br>       6 123 791</br>            5 666 733</br>       12 689 501</br>          12 098 801</br>     Net Long Term Liabilities</br>2 164 276</br>            1 965 991</br>       2 413 033</br>            2 068 569</br>       4 577 309</br>            4 034 560</br>       Other Liabilities</br>143 231</br>               312 696</br>          110 479</br>               108 455</br>          253 710</br>               421 151</br>          Total Liabilities</br>2 307 507</br>            2 278 687</br>       2 523 512</br>            2 177 024</br>       4 831 019</br>            4 455 711</br>       Net Assets:</br>Invested in Capital Assets  </br>Net of Related Debt</br>3 530 937</br>            3 518 704</br>       2 970 351</br>            2 933 012</br>       6 501 288</br>            6 451 716</br>       Restricted</br>564 605</br>               564 042</br>          42 485</br>                 39 436</br>            607 090</br>               603 478</br>          Unrestricted</br>162 661</br>               70 635</br>            587 443</br>               517 261</br>          750 104</br>               587 896</br>          Total Net Assets</br>4 258 203</br>$          4 153 381</br>$     3 600 279</br>$          3 489 709</br>$     7 858 482</br>$          7 643 090</br>$     Governmental Activities</br>Business Type Activities</br>Total Primary Government</br>   As noted earlier  net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government™s financial position.  In the case of </br>the </br>City  assets exceeded liabilities by $</br>7 858 482 at June 30  </br>2009  an increase of $2</br>15 392 over fiscal year 2008. </br>$6 501 288  or approximately </br>82%  of total Net Assets represent the City™s investment in capital assets  e.g.  land  structures and </br>improvements  equipment  distribution and collections systems  infrastructure  and construction</br> in progress   less any </br>outstandi</br>ng debt used to acquire these assets.  The City uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently  </br>these assets are not available for future spending.  Although the City™s investment in capital assets is reported net of rela</br>ted </br>debt  it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources  since the capital </br>assets themselves generally are not used to liquidate these liabilities. </br>$6</br>07 090</br>  </br>or approximately </br>8%  of total Net Assets represent resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may </br>be used.</br>  The remaining balance of $</br>750 104</br>  or approximately </br>10%  is available to finance ongoing services and obligations to </br>the City™s citizens and creditors.</br>   Unrestricted </br>Net Assets increased by $</br>162 2</br>08  or approximately </br>28%.
